1
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,870
Everybody, heads up!
Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,320
Keep it clear!

3
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,240
Stand back!

4
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,250
Bring it
forward, come on!

5
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,590
Slow it down!

6
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,440
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,520
- On your ready.
- I want Tasers on full charge.

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Steady!
Go on. Step back in.

9
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,290
Ready. Move it.

10
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,620
And push.

11
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,710
Locked. Loading team,
step away.

12
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,920
Move it.

13
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,350
Jophery, raise the gate.

14
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,030
Block the opening!
Don't let her get out!

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,170
Somebody help him!

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,170
Work her back!

17
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,180
Shoot her!

18
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,970
I heard that Hammond's
not even here.

19
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,480
<i>He sends his apologies.</i>

20
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,480
There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker

21
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,150
and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

22
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,360
He had to leave early, his
daughter's getting a divorce.

23
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,490
I understand, but we need to
deal with the situation now.

24
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,740
The insurance company...
You okay?

25
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,250
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

26
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,620
That makes the investors
very anxious.

27
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,300
I had to promise to conduct a very
thorough, on-site inspection.

28
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,380
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

29
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,180
I need to or they'll
pull the funding.

30
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,130
That'll slow him down
even more.

31
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,060
Watch your head.

32
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,940
If two experts sign off
on the island,

33
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,610
the insurance guys
will back off.

34
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,950
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

35
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,700
They want Alan Grant.
Grant?

36
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,030
You'll never get him
out of Montana.

37
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,450
Why not?

38
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,200
Why not?

39
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,540
Because Grant's like me.

40
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,960
He's a digger.

41
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,420
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

42
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,310
I hate computers.

43
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,270
The feeling's mutual.

44
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,450
Take a look.

45
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,580
Did it work?

46
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,160
How long
does this take?

47
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,740
Should bring
an immediate return.

48
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,290
You shoot the radar
into the ground,

49
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,710
and the bone bounces
the image back.

50
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,080
Bounces it back...

51
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,210
This new program
is incredible.

52
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,630
A few more
years' development,

53
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,260
and we won't even
have to dig anymore.

54
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,060
Where's the fun
in that?

55
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,140
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.

56
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,360
Post-mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments.

57
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,940
Velociraptor?

58
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,650
Yes. Good shape, too.

59
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,150
It's five, six feet high.
I'm guessing nine feet long.

60
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,570
Look...
What'd you do?

61
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,990
He touched it.

62
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,160
Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.

63
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,030
Hell, they've got it
in for me.

64
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,620
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.

65
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,370
It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.

66
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,550
No, seriously.

67
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,510
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present-day birds than with reptiles.

68
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,090
Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.

69
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,300
Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, like a bird.

70
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,690
And even the word "Raptor"
means "bird of prey."

71
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,440
That doesn't
look very scary.

72
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,360
More like a 6-foot turkey.

73
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,200
A turkey?

74
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,630
Imagine yourself in the
Cretaceous period.

75
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,360
Here we go.

76
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,630
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

77
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,880
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

78
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,380
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,

79
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,130
like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.

80
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,340
But no,
not Velociraptor.

81
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,850
You stare at him and he
just stares right back.

82
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,940
And that's when
the attack comes.

83
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,560
Not from the front,
but from the side.

84
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,440
From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.

85
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,990
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

86
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,950
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

87
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,330
and he is out
in force today.

88
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,830
And he slashes at you
with this,

89
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,580
a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.

90
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,590
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.

91
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,760
He slashes at you

92
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
here or here...

93
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,890
Alan.

94
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,220
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

95
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,480
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

96
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,490
So, you know, try to
show a little respect.

97
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,150
Okay.

98
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,410
Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

99
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,590
you could've pulled
a gun on him.

100
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,160
Yeah, I know. Kids.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You want to have
one of those?

102
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,790
I don't want that kid,

103
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,050
but a breed of the child
could be intriguing.

104
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,810
I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?

105
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,310
They're noisy, they're
messy, they're expensive.

106
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,890
Cheap, cheap.

107
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,390
They smell.

108
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,150
They don't smell!
Some smell.

109
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,520
Give me a break!
Babies smell.

110
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,160
Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!

111
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,490
Tell them to shut down!

112
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,820
Cut the machine!

113
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,500
Cover it all up.
Pull it over.

114
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,920
Just cut it, will you?
Shut it down!

115
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,750
What?

116
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,570
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

117
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,600
We were saving that.

118
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,770
For today, I guarantee it.

119
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
Who in God's name
do you think you are?

120
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,440
John Hammond.

121
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,820
And I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.

122
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,880
So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.

123
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,800
Who's the jerk?

124
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,130
This is our paleobotanist,
Dr...

125
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,300
Sattler.

126
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,680
Ellie, this
is Mr. Hammond.

127
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,140
I'm sorry about the dramatic
entrance, Dr. Sattler, but...

128
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.

129
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,730
Will you have a drink? We won't
let it get warm. Sit down.

130
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,560
Let me have this.
I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

131
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,190
There's samples
all over here.

132
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,900
I know my way
around the kitchen.

133
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,150
Now, I'll get right
to the point.

134
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,080
I like you.
Both of you.

135
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,740
I can tell instantly about people.
It's a gift.

136
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,000
I own an island off the
coast of Costa Rica.

137
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,090
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years,

138
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,670
I've been setting up
a biological preserve.

139
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,130
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

140
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,680
Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.

141
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,730
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

142
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,510
And what are those?

143
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,390
Small versions of
adults, honey.

144
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,400
And not just kids,
everyone.

145
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,820
We're going to open next year, if
the lawyers don't kill me first.

146
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,110
I don't care for
lawyers, do you?

147
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,830
I don't really know any.
Don't really know any.

148
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,000
I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.

149
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,080
Says that they insist
on outside opinions.

150
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,790
What kind of opinions?

151
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,910
Well, your kind, not to put
too fine a point on it.

152
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,090
Let's face it, in your particular
fields, you're the top minds.

153
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,640
And if I could just
persuade you

154
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,260
to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,

155
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,940
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

156
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,320
Why would they care
what we think?

157
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,940
What kind of park
is this?

158
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
It's right up your alley.

159
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,330
Why don't you come down, just the
pair of you, for the weekend?

160
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,580
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

161
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,580
I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.

162
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm sorry.
This isn't possible.

163
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,210
We just dug up
a new skeleton...

164
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,260
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

165
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,350
This is a very unusual time.
The timing is...

166
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,390
...for a further
three years.

167
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,100
Where's the plane?

168
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,020
Okay.
Three years.

169
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,400
Cheers.

170
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,940
Dodgson!

171
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,910
You shouldn't use my name.

172
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,750
Dodgson. We've got
Dodgson here.

173
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,580
See, nobody cares.
Nice hat.

174
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,170
What're you trying to look
like, a secret agent?

175
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,840
Well?
$750,000.

176
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,840
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

177
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,010
That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.

178
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,220
I'll get them all.

179
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,230
Remember, viable embryos. They're
no use to us if they don't survive.

180
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,520
How am I supposed
to transport them?

181
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,070
The bottom screws open.

182
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,360
That's great.
Oh, my God.

183
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,790
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

184
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,450
You guys.
That's great.

185
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,280
Customs can even check it
if they want to.

186
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,870
Let me see.
Go on.

187
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,580
There's enough coolant
for 36 hours.

188
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,830
No menthol?

189
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,710
The embryos have to be back
here in San José by then.

190
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,800
That's up to your guy
on the boat.

191
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,000
7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

192
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,630
How are you planning
to beat security?

193
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,310
I've got
an 18-minute window.

194
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,890
Eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

195
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.

196
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
That was
Hammond's mistake.

197
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,120
So you two
dig up dinosaurs?

198
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,670
Well...
We try to.

199
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,640
You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.

200
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,520
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

201
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
especially for
a mathematician.

202
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,060
Chaotician. Chaotician,
actually.

203
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,940
John doesn't subscribe
to chaos,

204
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,520
particularly what it says
about his science project.

205
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,330
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

206
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,280
Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?

207
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,620
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...

208
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,960
Don't.

209
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,120
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

210
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,410
No.

211
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,790
No? Non-linear equations?

212
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,630
Strange attractors?

213
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,630
I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.

214
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,770
I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.

215
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,320
There it is.

216
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,390
Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast.

217
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,310
Hold on, this will
be thrilling.

218
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,420
But you need that piece over
here, and that piece...

219
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,590
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

220
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,510
Great.

221
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,380
The full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place?

222
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,680
And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.

223
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,970
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

224
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,140
Let's get this straight. This
is not a weekend excursion.

225
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,310
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

226
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,560
Your investors, whom I
represent, are deeply concerned.

227
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,520
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

228
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,700
I'll shut you down, John.

229
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,540
In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.

230
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,130
All right, slow down.
Slow. Stop!

231
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,010
This shouldn't be here.

232
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,150
Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct

233
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,580
since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

234
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,910
What?

235
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,860
Look at that.

236
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,240
It's a dinosaur.

237
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,910
You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.

238
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,920
We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. it doesn't apply.

239
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,340
They're wrong. This is
a warm-blooded creature.

240
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,920
This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This thing's got
a 25, 27-foot neck?

242
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,510
<i>The Brachiosaurus?
30.</i>

243
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,590
Thirty feet.

244
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,940
We're gonna make
a fortune with this place.

245
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,240
How fast are they?

246
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,580
Well, we clocked the T-Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

247
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,830
T-Rex?

248
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,920
You said you've
got a T-Rex?

249
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,130
Say again.

250
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,630
We have a T-Rex.

251
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,760
Put your head
between your knees.

252
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,350
Dr. Grant,

253
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,770
my dear Dr. Sattler,

254
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,350
welcome to Jurassic Park.

255
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,920
They're moving in herds.

256
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,880
They do move in herds.

257
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,270
How did you do this?

258
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,400
I'll show you.

259
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,500
Good day.

260
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,550
The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

261
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,720
incorporating all
the latest technologies.

262
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,220
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

263
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,650
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding

264
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,820
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

265
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
So, what are you thinking?

266
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,990
That we're out of a job.

267
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,740
Don't you mean "extinct"?

268
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

269
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,630
Here he comes.
Well, here I come.

270
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,470
<i>Hello.</i>

271
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,130
Say hello.

272
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,930
Hello.

273
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,220
<i>Hello, John.</i>

274
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes, I've got lines.

275
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,270
<i>Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</i>

276
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,270
Well, let me show you. First,
I'll need a drop of blood.

277
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,110
Your blood.

278
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,440
<i>Right.</i>

279
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,280
<i>That hurt.</i>

280
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,450
Relax, John. It's all
part of the miracle of cloning.

281
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,960
<i>Hello, John.</i>

282
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,330
Cloned from what?

283
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,040
Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.

284
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,790
Not without massive
sequence gaps.

285
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,170
Paleo-DNA,
from what source?

286
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,960
Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?

287
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,310
<i>What? What?</i>

288
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,110
<i>Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?</i>

289
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,430
<i>From your blood.</i>

290
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,070
<i>Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,</i>

291
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,440
<i>the building blocks of life.</i>

292
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:10,070
<i>A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.</i>

293
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,500
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,</i>

294
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,550
<i>left their blueprints behind for us to
find. We just had to know where to look.</i>

295
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,590
<i>A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.</i>

296
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,170
<i>And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.</i>

297
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,060
<i>Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,</i>

298
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,020
<i>mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</i>

299
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,900
<i>After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,</i>

300
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,900
<i>just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</i>

301
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,200
<i>This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber,</i>

302
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,960
<i>waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside</i>

303
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,960
<i>until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.</i>

304
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,000
<i>Using sophisticated
techniques,</i>

305
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,180
<i>they extract
the preserved blood</i>

306
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,600
<i>from the mosquito,
dino DNA!</i>

307
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,930
<i>A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.</i>

308
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,650
<i>If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,</i>

309
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,850
<i>it'd take two years to look
at the entire DNA strand.</i>

310
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,160
<i>It's that long. Since it's
so old, it's full of holes.</i>

311
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,910
<i>Now that's where our
geneticists take over.</i>

312
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,120
<i>Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers</i>

313
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,370
<i>break down the strand
in minutes.</i>

314
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,500
<i>And virtual-reality displays</i>

315
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,750
<i>show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</i>

316
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,840
<i>We used the complete
DNA of a frog</i>

317
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,840
<i>to fill in the holes
and complete the code.</i>

318
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,220
<i>Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</i>

319
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,690
This score
is only temporary.

320
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,270
It all has very dramatic
music, of course.

321
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,690
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

322
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,770
And then, the tour moves on.

323
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,120
<i>Well, look here. Those
hard-working cowpokes you see behind us...</i>

324
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,630
This is overwhelming, John.

325
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,050
Are these characters
autoerotica?

326
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,850
No, we have no
animatronics here.

327
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,970
Those people are the real miracle
workers of Jurassic Park.

328
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,270
<i>...In unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs.</i>

329
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,320
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

330
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,890
Can't we see
the unfertilized eggs?

331
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,100
Shortly.

332
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,150
<i>Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...</i>

333
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,450
Can't you stop
these things?

334
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,620
I'm sorry.
It's kind of a ride.

335
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,660
One, two, three.

336
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,420
- You can't do that.
- What?

337
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,990
Can they do that?

338
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,660
<i>The boat for the mainland</i>

339
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,870
<i>will be leaving at 1900.</i>

340
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,930
<i>All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.</i>

341
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,430
Good day, Henry.

342
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,850
Good day, sir.

343
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,490
It's turning the eggs.

344
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,200
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

345
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,830
Henry, why
didn't you tell me?

346
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,880
I insist on being here
when they're born.

347
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,960
Come on.

348
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,220
Come on, little one.

349
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,930
Come on, then.

350
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,110
Very good. Push.

351
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,230
- Very good.
- God.

352
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,730
Push. Come on.

353
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,240
Come on. Come on, then.

354
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,370
There you are.

355
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,790
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

356
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,750
That's it.
Helps them to trust me.

357
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,590
I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.

358
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,680
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?

359
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,090
Actually they can't
breed in the wild.

360
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,020
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

361
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

362
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,520
How do you know
they can't breed?

363
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,110
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

364
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,570
We've engineered them
that way.

365
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,280
There you are.

366
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

367
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,040
Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.

368
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,250
Wu?

369
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,630
Ninety-one.

370
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,840
Homoeothermic?
It holds that temperature?

371
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,010
Yes.

372
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,470
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

373
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,730
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

374
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,440
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

375
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,110
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.

376
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,360
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage

377
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,860
to make them male.

378
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,990
We simply deny them that.

379
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,910
Deny them that?

380
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,960
John, the kind of control you're
attempting is not possible.

381
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,200
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

382
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,660
it's that life will
not be contained.

383
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,000
Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories

384
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,300
and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

385
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,500
but there it is.

386
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,680
There it is.

387
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:09,140
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

388
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,650
No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.

389
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,690
What species is this?

390
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,410
It's a Velociraptor.

391
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,120
You bred Raptors?

392
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,610
Dr. Grant!

393
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,040
As I was saying, we laid on lunch for
you before you go into the park.

394
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,190
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
What are they doing?

395
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,070
Feeding them.

396
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,530
Alejandro's prepared a
delightful menu for us.

397
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,560
Chilean sea bass, I believe.

398
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,670
Shall we?

399
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,710
They should all be destroyed.

400
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,790
Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.

401
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,880
Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.

402
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,090
What's their growth rate?

403
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,390
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

404
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,140
I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...

405
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,470
Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.

406
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,850
Fifty, sixty miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open.

407
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,220
And they're
astonishing jumpers.

408
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,480
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

409
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,400
Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...

410
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,200
They show extreme
intelligence.

411
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,740
Even problem-solving
intelligence.

412
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,070
Especially the big one.

413
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,910
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in,

414
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,330
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.

415
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:42,170
That one, when she looks at you, you
can see she's working things out.

416
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,970
That's why we have to
feed them like this.

417
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,050
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

418
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,590
The fences are electrified,
right?

419
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,050
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

420
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,810
They were testing the fences for
weaknesses, systematically.

421
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,640
They remember.

422
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,710
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

423
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,080
<i>More
adventurous guests, of course,</i>

424
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,790
<i>can opt for our
jungle river cruise</i>

425
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,250
<i>or for a close-up look
at our majestic...</i>

426
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,630
None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open

427
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,050
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line

428
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,380
six or twelve months
after that.

429
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,760
Absolutely spectacular
designs.

430
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,720
Spared no expense.

431
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,140
And we can charge
anything we want.

432
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,940
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

433
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,730
And there's
the merchandise...

434
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,900
Donald.

435
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,570
This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.

436
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,770
Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.

437
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,410
Sure. They will. We'll have
a coupon day or something.

438
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:03,580
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

439
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,670
Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.

440
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,880
I know.
They're a lot worse.

441
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,090
Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...

442
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,100
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

443
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:23,060
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

444
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,490
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen

445
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,530
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

446
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,820
It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...

447
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,660
If I may.

448
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,030
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

449
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,120
It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

450
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,870
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

451
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,420
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

452
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,630
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

453
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,510
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

454
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,710
something as fast
as you could.

455
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,020
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it

456
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,940
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.

457
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,060
You're going to sell it.

458
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,060
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

459
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,400
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

460
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,610
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

461
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,570
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

462
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,660
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

463
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,920
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

464
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,620
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

465
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,420
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

466
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,720
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

467
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:36,170
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.

468
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,850
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

469
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,850
How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?

470
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,360
What's so great
about discovery?

471
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,610
It's a violent,
penetrative act,

472
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,030
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

473
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,740
I call the rape of
the natural world.

474
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,200
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

475
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,410
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

476
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,460
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

477
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,040
You picked them
because they look good.

478
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,420
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

479
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,680
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

480
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,390
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here

481
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,730
who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...

482
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,950
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

483
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,660
I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

484
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,700
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution

485
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,120
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

486
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,580
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?

487
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,470
I don't believe it.

488
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,220
You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters

489
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,340
and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

490
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,840
Thank you.

491
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,940
They're here.

492
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,730
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

493
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,440
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

494
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,120
Grandpa!
Kids!

495
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,910
Wait! Careful with me.

496
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,040
We missed you.

497
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,290
Me, too.

498
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,830
We loved the presents.
They were great.

499
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,040
Did you enjoy
the helicopter?

500
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

501
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,300
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

502
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,140
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though?

503
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,390
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

504
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,470
No drivers?

505
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,560
No. No drivers.
They're electric.

506
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,390
They run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here.

507
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,320
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

508
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,400
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

509
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,530
You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

510
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,700
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

511
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,370
Dr. Grant, come in
the second car.

512
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm gonna ride
with Dr. Sattler.

513
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,340
I read your book.

514
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,020
That's great.

515
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,760
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

516
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,180
A few species may have
evolved along those lines.

517
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,030
Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.

518
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,780
I heard that there
was this meteor,

519
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,120
hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.

520
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,790
Listen...

521
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,910
Tim.

522
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,590
Tim, which car
were you planning on?

523
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,340
Whichever one you are.

524
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,890
Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

525
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,720
It made diamond dust and
that changed the weather.

526
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,270
They died because
of the weather.

527
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,690
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

528
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,020
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

529
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,450
<i>The boat is now loading.</i>

530
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,370
<i>Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.</i>

531
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,500
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm

532
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,330
about 75 miles west of us.

533
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,130
Why didn't I build
in Orlando?

534
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,960
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll
swing south like the last one.

535
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,930
Ray, start the tour program.

536
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,110
Hold onto your butts.

537
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,040
<i>And why did
they put the fiberglass thing?</i>

538
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,580
<i>I know.</i>

539
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,130
You want to
join the future, right?

540
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,710
God help us when
the hands of engineers...

541
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,050
<i>During your tour,</i>

542
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,760
<i>the appropriate
information will be</i>

543
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,970
<i>automatically selected
and displayed for you.</i>

544
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,100
Look!

545
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,100
<i>Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</i>

546
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,350
Are we gonna hit that?

547
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,150
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park.</i>

548
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,150
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

549
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,750
The voice you're now
hearing is Richard Kiley.

550
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,090
We spared no expense.

551
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,380
<i>If you look to the right,</i>

552
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,260
<i>you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</i>

553
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,590
Dilophosaurus!

554
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,680
Shit!

555
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,680
<i>One of the earliest
carnivores,</i>

556
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,980
<i>we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous</i>

557
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,410
<i>spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,</i>

558
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,570
<i>allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</i>

559
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,950
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition</i>

560
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,870
<i>to Jurassic Park.</i>

561
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,370
Alan?

562
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,630
Where?

563
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,550
Damn.

564
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,640
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

565
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,220
Those shouldn't be running
off of car batteries.

566
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,400
Item 151 on
today's glitch list.

567
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,100
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo

568
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,190
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

569
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:15,040
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?

570
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,170
I am totally unappreciated
in my time.

571
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,090
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

572
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,210
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

573
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,960
You know anybody who can
network eight machines

574
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,530
and de-bug two million lines
of code on my salary?

575
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,870
If so, I want to see them.

576
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,870
Sorry about your financial
problems, I really am.

577
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,550
But they are your problems.

578
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,020
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

579
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,600
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.

580
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,940
I really will not.

581
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,270
There's been hardly
any debate at all.

582
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,900
I don't blame people
for their mistakes.

583
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,610
But I do ask that
they pay for them.

584
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,200
Thanks, Dad.

585
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,540
The headlights.

586
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,740
I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

587
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,870
It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.

588
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,300
We'll lose part
of the system.

589
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,540
There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

590
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,170
Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...

591
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,250
Quiet, all of you!

592
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,140
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

593
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,900
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

594
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,780
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

595
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,490
Dinosaurs eat man.

596
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,040
Woman inherits the earth.

597
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,040
<i>We'll try
to tempt the Rex now.</i>

598
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,240
<i>Keep watching the fence.</i>

599
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,810
What's going to happen
to the goat?

600
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,230
He's going to eat the goat?

601
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,030
Excellent.

602
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,980
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

603
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,820
I happen to be
a vegetarian.

604
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,380
T-Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

605
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:18,090
You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

606
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,950
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

607
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,920
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

608
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660
I really hate that man.

609
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,590
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any
set patterns or park schedules.

610
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,850
The essence of chaos.

611
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,970
I'm still not
clear on chaos.

612
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,560
It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.

613
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,400
The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.

614
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,400
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking

615
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,780
and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.

616
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,580
Was I going too fast?
I missed it.

617
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,660
I did a fly-by.

618
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,370
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

619
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,080
We should be still.
The car's bouncing.

620
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,790
That's okay.
It's just an example.

621
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,250
Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

622
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,430
A drop of water falls
on your hand.

623
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,600
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

624
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,140
Thumb, I'd say.

625
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,810
Freeze your hand.
Don't move.

626
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,860
I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.

627
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,520
Which way, now?

628
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,570
Let's say back
the same way.

629
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,280
It changed. Why?

630
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,660
Because tiny variations,

631
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,610
the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

632
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,290
Alan, look at this.

633
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,040
...the amount of blood distending your
vessels, imperfections in the skin...

634
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,040
"imperfections in the skin"?

635
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,710
...just microscopic,

636
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,750
never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome.

637
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:19,960
That's what?

638
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
Unpredictability.

639
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,260
There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.

640
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,310
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant would
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

641
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,400
And there's another example.

642
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,910
See, here I am now by
myself, talking to myself.

643
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,260
That's Chaos Theory.

644
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,570
Stop the program.

645
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:52,950
I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

646
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,660
<i>Stopping park
vehicles and rebooting program.</i>

647
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,000
<i>We're on.
Will notify for resume.</i>

648
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,510
I'll switch it
over to TelePrompTer.

649
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,050
What about
the circuit integrities?

650
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,670
Screen says faulty sensor.

651
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,680
I'll call security.

652
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,100
We're at full go
on that and it looks good.

653
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,150
Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker

654
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,020
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.

655
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,440
Where are we going?

656
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,240
He didn't say
they turned into birds.

657
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,610
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

658
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,570
And his book was a lot fatter
than yours. Like this.

659
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,400
Really? Yours was
fully illustrated.

660
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,210
You Okay?

661
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,660
Look at this.
Wait. Watch.

662
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,460
Come on. Watch this.

663
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,580
Whoa.

664
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,380
Everybody stay here.

665
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,020
Wow.

666
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,650
Okay?

667
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,820
Of course.

668
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,530
Don't be scared.
Come on, it's okay.

669
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,530
Muldoon tranquillized her
for me.

670
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,990
She's sick.

671
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,300
Oh, my God.

672
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,310
Hey, baby.

673
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,360
She was always my favorite
when I was a kid

674
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,160
and now I see she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

675
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,750
It's okay.

676
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,210
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

677
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,550
Thanks.
What are her symptoms?

678
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,180
Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.

679
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,130
It seems to happen
every six weeks or so.

680
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,390
Six weeks.

681
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,910
These are dilated.
They are?

682
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,780
Take a look.

683
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,980
I'll be damned.

684
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,620
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

685
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,790
Is this West Indian lilac?

686
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,920
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

687
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,890
Are you sure?

688
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,010
Pretty sure.

689
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,810
There's only one way
to be positive.

690
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,150
I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.

691
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,270
Dino droppings?
Droppings?

692
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,360
Yeah, I got that.

693
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,870
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

694
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,500
We're gonna have to
cut the tour short.

695
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,380
We'll pick it up
again tomorrow.

696
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,500
Are you sure we have to?

697
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,630
It's not worth
taking the chance.

698
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:30,710
Sustained winds at 45 knots.

699
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,390
Tell them when they get
back in the cars.

700
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:38,090
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

701
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,520
Drop what you're doing
and leave now.

702
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,770
Damn!

703
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,530
That is one
big pile of shit.

704
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,660
You're right. There's no
trace of lilac berries.

705
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,870
That's so odd, though.

706
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:10,000
All right, she's suffering
from <i>Melia</i> toxicity

707
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,710
every six weeks.

708
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,060
Let's see, rats.

709
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,850
She's tenacious.

710
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,480
You have no idea.

711
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,190
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

712
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,670
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

713
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,680
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

714
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,050
Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.

715
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,060
I'll drop her off at the
center before I make the boat.

716
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,850
Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.

717
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,020
You sure?

718
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,850
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

719
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,350
Okay, then.

720
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:26,710
<i>There's nothing I can do. The captain
says we got to go, we got to go.</i>

721
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,330
You've got to
give me the time.

722
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,760
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18

723
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,380
but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

724
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,260
<i>No promises.</i>

725
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,140
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

726
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:53,600
So much for our first tour. Two
no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

727
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,560
It could've been worse.

728
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:59,190
A lot worse.

729
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:03,030
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

730
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,280
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

731
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,460
I've had only sweets and I'm
gonna get something salty.

732
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,710
I finished
debugging the phones.

733
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,000
I was going to, so I did.

734
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,210
So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe

735
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,510
I should tell you the system
will be compiling

736
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,060
for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems,

737
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:29,100
they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

738
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,460
DO you got any kids?

739
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,510
Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.

740
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,630
Anything at all can
and does happen.

741
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,680
Same with wives,
for that matter.

742
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,260
You're married?

743
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,510
Occasionally.

744
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,980
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

745
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,740
Five, four, three,

746
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,870
two, one.

747
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,340
- That's odd.
- What?

748
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,930
Door security systems
are shutting down.

749
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,260
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

750
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,610
By the way, Dr. Sattler,

751
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,700
she's not available,
is she?

752
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,900
Why?

753
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,450
I'm sorry. You two are...

754
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,580
Yeah.

755
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,000
What'd I touch?

756
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,500
You didn't touch anything.
We stopped.

757
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,350
What the hell?

758
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,470
What now?

759
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,480
Fences are failing
all over the park.

760
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,980
Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.

761
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,600
Just look at this
work station.

762
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,270
What a complete slob.

763
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,690
The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

764
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,440
No, no. They're still on.

765
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,410
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

766
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,330
Access main program.

767
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,750
Access main security.

768
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,870
Access main program grid.

769
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,340
<i>You didn't say
the magic word.</i>

770
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,300
Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

771
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,930
Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.

772
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,890
Phones are out, too.

773
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,980
Where did the vehicles stop?

774
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,960
Their radio's out, too.

775
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,380
Gennaro said to stay put.
Kids okay?

776
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,590
I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?

777
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,510
Kids get scared.
What's scary?

778
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,550
It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I'm not scared.

779
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,680
I didn't say
you were scared.

780
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,980
I know.

781
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,270
Boo!

782
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,810
Hey, where did
you find those?

783
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,440
In the box,
under my seat.

784
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,820
Are they heavy?

785
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,940
Yeah. Then they're expensive.
Put them back.

786
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,370
Don't scare me.

787
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,670
Cool. Night vision.

788
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,950
Did you feel that?

789
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,440
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

790
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,200
What is that?

791
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,590
Where's the goat?

792
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,830
Jesus!

793
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,620
He left us.

794
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,470
Where does he think
he's going?

795
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,470
When you got to go,
you got to go.

796
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,780
Dr. Grant.

797
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,670
I hate being
right all the time.

798
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,940
Keep absolutely still. its
vision is based on movement.

799
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:50,700
Turn the light off.

800
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,420
Turn the light off!

801
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:54,720
Hurry! Turn it off!

802
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,930
I'm sorry!

803
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,740
You're the one
who turned it...

804
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,440
Ian, freeze!

805
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,230
Get the kids!

806
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,150
Get rid of the flare!

807
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,530
Get the kids!

808
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,070
Get rid of the flare!

809
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,830
Hail Mary,
full of grace...

810
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,420
No!

811
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,810
Dr. Grant!

812
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,730
I'm stuck.
The seat's got my feet.

813
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,570
I'll get you next.
You're okay.

814
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,940
You're all right.

815
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,280
Tim!

816
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:20,370
Don't move. He can't see
us if we don't move.

817
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,810
Lex, you're choking me.

818
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,820
Grab the wire.

819
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:55,130
"Keycheck space minus 0. Keychecks
off, safety space minus 0."

820
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:58,430
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

821
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,930
Look at this next entry. It's the kicker.
"White rabbit object."

822
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,390
It did it all.
With the keychecks off,

823
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,850
the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.

824
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:09,610
The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.

825
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,360
How many lines of
code are there?

826
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,110
About two million.

827
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,780
Two million?
Yeah.

828
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:22,290
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep

829
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,120
and bring back
my grandchildren.

830
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,290
Sure.

831
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,750
I'm going with him.

832
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:36,970
John.

833
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,520
I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.

834
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,060
Should have been
there by now.

835
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,620
Damn it!

836
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,750
There's the road!

837
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,350
Winch this sucker off the thing and
then I tie it to that thing there.

838
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,680
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

839
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:41,580
My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!

840
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,150
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

841
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,110
Hello.

842
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,790
Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.

843
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,170
Nice boy.

844
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,800
Nice dinosaur.

845
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,510
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

846
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,480
What do you want?
A little food?

847
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,060
Look at me.
I just fell down a hill.

848
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,640
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

849
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,200
Go on. Play fetch?

850
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,030
Look, stick.

851
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,040
Look at stick.

852
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,830
Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
Look at the stick.

853
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,660
You like the stick?
Go on and get it.

854
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,050
No wonder you're extinct.

855
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,750
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

856
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,620
Timmy!

857
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,970
Now, Lex. Listen.

858
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,930
Lex, I'm right here.

859
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,350
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

860
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,890
Stay right here
and wait for me.

861
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:56,310
He left us.

862
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,810
But that's not what
I'm going to do.

863
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,560
Okay?

864
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,360
Stay here.

865
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,220
You hear me?
I'm coming up.

866
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:39,900
I hate climbing. I hate
trees, way too high.

867
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,420
You Okay?

868
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,680
I threw up.

869
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:17,850
That's okay.

870
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,520
Just give me your hand.

871
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,810
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

872
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:39,280
Here, I've got you.

873
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,080
Okay.

874
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,090
That's good.
Over the rail.

875
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,540
Don't pull me too hard.

876
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,130
Stand on the door.
Hang on to me.

877
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,680
That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
Yes, it is.

878
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,260
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

879
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,100
No.
Yeah, me, too.

880
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,360
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

881
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,230
This is impossible.

882
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,690
How am I going to do this?
It's about...

883
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,870
I'm going to help you
with your footing.

884
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,160
Oh, no.

885
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,290
Tim, go.

886
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:45,640
Go, Tim, go!

887
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,910
Faster, Tim!

888
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,000
Tim, jump!

889
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:07,330
Go, Tim.

890
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,340
We're back
in the car again.

891
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,560
At least
you're out of the tree.

892
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,900
Where's the other car?

893
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:34,860
Alan!

894
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,030
Dr. Grant!

895
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,050
I think this was Gennaro.

896
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,420
I think this was, too.

897
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,010
I think it's ahead of us.

898
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,560
It could be anywhere.

899
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,390
With fences down, it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes.

900
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,270
He's put
a tourniquet on. Ian.

901
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:19,610
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

902
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:26,200
Can we chance moving him?

903
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,250
Please chance it.

904
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,140
Ellie, come on!

905
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,150
It's the other car!

906
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,360
Dr. Grant?

907
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,980
They're not here.

908
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,680
Anybody hear that?

909
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,680
It's an impact tremor,
is what it is.

910
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,480
I'm fairly alarmed here.

911
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:40,490
Come on. We've got to get
out of here. Now! Right now!

912
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,740
Let's go.

913
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,120
Must go faster.

914
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:00,760
Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!

915
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:08,930
Get off the stick!
Bloody move!

916
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:10,180
Look out!

917
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,590
Think they'll have
that on the tour?

918
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,600
Are you hearing this?

919
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:58,100
Come on, Tim.
Hurry up.

920
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,030
Let's get up this tree.

921
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:06,530
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

922
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,580
Oh, man.

923
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,210
I hate trees.

924
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,040
They don't bother me.

925
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,710
Yeah? Well, you weren't
in the last one.

926
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,470
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

927
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,480
They're singing.

928
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,220
Don't let the monsters
come over here.

929
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,800
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

930
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,600
They only eat vegetables. For you,
I think they'd make an exception.

931
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,350
I hate the other kind.

932
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:22,650
They just do what they do.

933
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,840
What's that?

934
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:52,760
What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

935
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,430
I don't know.

936
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,430
I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.

937
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:04,990
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

938
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:09,200
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

939
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,990
"Do-you-think-he-saurus."

940
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,200
What do you call
a blind dinosaur's dog?

941
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:19,450
You got me.

942
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,630
A "Do-you-think
- he-saurus rex."

943
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,210
Alan?

944
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:26,380
Yeah?

945
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,210
What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?

946
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:34,720
I'll stay awake.
All night?

947
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:38,600
All night.

948
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,570
They were all melting.

949
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,650
Malcolm's okay for now. I
gave him a shot of morphine.

950
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:42,620
They'll be fine.

951
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:47,920
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

952
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,130
You know, the first

953
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,890
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland

954
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:03,220
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

955
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,230
Really quite wonderful.

956
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:10,060
I had a wee trapeze
and a

957
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:14,520
carousel

958
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,820
and a seesaw.

959
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:23,160
They all move motorized,
of course.

960
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:26,160
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.

961
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,000
"Can't you see the fleas?"

962
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:33,090
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

963
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:40,850
With this place,

964
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,270
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

965
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:50,360
Something that was real.
Something that they could

966
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,020
see and touch.

967
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,160
An aim not
devoid of merit.

968
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:10,290
But you can't think through this
one, John. You have to feel it.

969
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,550
You're absolutely right.

970
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,390
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

971
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:21,140
We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.

972
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,890
Next time,
everything's correctable.

973
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:28,150
Creation is an act
of sheer will.

974
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:32,520
Next time,
it'll be flawless.

975
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:36,230
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

976
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:37,730
When we have control...

977
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,570
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

978
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:43,650
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

979
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,160
I made a mistake, too.

980
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,240
I didn't have enough respect for
that power, and it's out now.

981
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,210
The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.

982
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,170
Alan and Lex and Tim.

983
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,930
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

984
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:23,360
It's good.

985
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,830
Spared no expense.

986
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:56,890
Go away!

987
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:59,320
It's okay.
It's a Brachiosaurus.

988
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:02,400
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

989
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,160
Veggie.

990
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:06,820
Come on. Come on, girl.

991
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:11,990
Come on, baby.

992
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,340
Go.

993
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I'm not letting go.

994
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:33,440
It looks like
it has a cold.

995
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,140
Yeah. Maybe.

996
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,390
Can I touch it?
Sure.

997
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,600
Just think of it
as kind of a big cow.

998
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,700
I like cows.

999
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,410
Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

1000
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,550
God bless you.

1001
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:13,600
Yuck.
Great.

1002
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,680
Now she'll never
try anything new.

1003
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:19,150
She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.

1004
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:20,190
I'm a hacker.

1005
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,990
That's what I said.
You're a nerd.

1006
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:23,610
I am not
a computer nerd.

1007
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:25,440
I prefer to be
called a hacker.

1008
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:26,910
God.

1009
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:33,580
You know what this is?

1010
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,160
It's a dinosaur egg.

1011
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:41,080
The dinosaurs are breeding.

1012
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:48,680
But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

1013
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:52,260
Amphibian DNA.
What's that?

1014
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,760
Well, on the tour,

1015
01:30:55,850 --> 01:31:00,850
the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

1016
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:04,650
They mutated the dinosaur
genetic code

1017
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:07,940
and blended it with
that of frogs.

1018
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:14,960
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female

1019
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:17,130
in a single sex environment.

1020
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,500
Malcolm was right.

1021
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,260
Look.

1022
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,560
Life found a way.

1023
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,480
No. That's crazy.
You're out of your mind.

1024
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,520
He's absolutely
out of his mind.

1025
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:42,940
Wait. What exactly
would this mean?

1026
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,480
We're talking about
a calculated risk,

1027
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,150
which is the only
option left to us.

1028
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:52,280
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

1029
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,240
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

1030
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,740
So, shutting down
the entire system...

1031
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:59,830
Get somebody else.
I won't do it.

1032
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:05,460
Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did.

1033
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:09,930
Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back

1034
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,550
on their original
start-up mode. Correct?

1035
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:15,980
Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.

1036
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,550
It may not come back on.

1037
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,930
Would we get
the phones back?

1038
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:21,100
Yes, again, in theory.

1039
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,520
What about
the lysine contingency?

1040
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,100
We could put
that into effect.

1041
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,030
What's that?

1042
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,980
That's absolutely out
of the question.

1043
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,940
The lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals,

1044
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,870
if they ever get
off the island.

1045
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:36,620
Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1046
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,620
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

1047
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:43,500
Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1048
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:46,210
People are dying.

1049
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,590
Will you please shut
down the system?

1050
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:16,490
Hold on to your butts.

1051
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:37,340
It's okay.

1052
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:40,100
Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.

1053
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,600
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

1054
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,690
Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

1055
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:49,190
Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:

1056
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:52,610
telephones, security doors, half
dozen others, but it worked.

1057
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:55,030
System's ready.
Where are the breakers?

1058
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:56,980
Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.

1059
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:59,660
Three minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.

1060
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,960
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker

1061
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:06,660
until Mr. Arnold returns, and the
whole system's running again.

1062
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,120
I'm tired.
I'm dirty.

1063
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,710
I'm hot.

1064
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:13,540
Looking at the map, I'd say the
visitor's center is just a mile

1065
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:17,510
over that rise there.
Just keep...

1066
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:21,890
What is that?

1067
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:25,430
Tim, can you tell me
what they are?

1068
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:29,150
They are

1069
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,280
Gallimimus.

1070
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,570
Are those meat-eating?

1071
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,030
"Meat-asauruses"?

1072
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,660
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

1073
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,210
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

1074
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:55,340
They're flocking this way.

1075
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,050
I want to go now.

1076
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:40,250
Just look how it eats.

1077
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,640
Please.

1078
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,390
I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.

1079
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:46,560
Yes.
Go now.

1080
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,150
Okay. Keep low
and follow me.

1081
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,360
Look how much blood.

1082
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,690
God. Something went wrong.

1083
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:04,120
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

1084
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:08,420
This is just a delay.

1085
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:11,750
That's all it is. All major
theme parks have delays.

1086
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:16,170
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.

1087
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:18,920
If the Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,

1088
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,130
the pirates don't
eat tourists.

1089
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:23,810
I can't wait any more.
Somethings wrong.

1090
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,260
I'm gonna go get
the power back on.

1091
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:28,720
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?

1092
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,980
Don't be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone...

1093
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:36,190
I'm going with you.
Okay.

1094
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,420
Sorry.

1095
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:01,750
Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.

1096
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,220
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

1097
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,850
Right.

1098
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:18,950
But it ought to be me,
really, going.

1099
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:20,020
Why?

1100
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,030
I'm a... And you're a...

1101
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,700
Look.
Come on, let's go.

1102
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:28,950
We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.

1103
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:32,700
You just take me through this
step by step. I'm on Channel 2.

1104
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,130
Right.

1105
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,490
The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.

1106
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:17,120
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

1107
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:23,670
Come on, this way.

1108
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:33,520
I can see the shed
from here.

1109
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:35,560
We can make it if we run.

1110
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,230
No. We can't.

1111
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:40,730
Why not?

1112
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:42,730
Because we're being hunted.

1113
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:46,230
In the bushes,
straight ahead.

1114
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,660
It's all right.

1115
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:52,450
Like hell it is.

1116
01:38:53,450 --> 01:38:56,620
Run. Towards the shed.

1117
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:00,300
I've got her.

1118
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,750
Go. Now!

1119
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:23,310
Mr. Arnold?

1120
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:30,240
John, I'm in.

1121
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,700
Great.

1122
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:36,490
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

1123
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:39,790
<i>Okay.</i> Going down.

1124
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,500
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

1125
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:45,710
Have her follow
the main cable.

1126
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:48,010
I know how to read
a schematic.

1127
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:19,530
I guess that means
the power's off.

1128
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,880
That's not funny.

1129
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:36,340
That was great.

1130
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,560
Well, maybe we, we could...

1131
01:40:58,410 --> 01:41:00,910
Damn it. Dead end.

1132
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,710
Wait a minute.

1133
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,380
There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.

1134
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,300
Look above you.

1135
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,680
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.

1136
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,180
Follow that.

1137
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:18,760
Okay.
Following the piping.

1138
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:25,900
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1139
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,150
What would you give me?

1140
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,320
Respect.

1141
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:31,320
Come on, guys,
it's not a race.

1142
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,580
I see the box.

1143
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:39,030
It <i>says,</i> "High Voltage."
Yeah.

1144
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,250
Okay.

1145
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,840
Good. Here we go.

1146
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,720
Over the top.

1147
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:53,960
Take your time.

1148
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:55,800
Good. Come on.

1149
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,640
Find your footing.

1150
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,600
You can't throw
the main switch by hand.

1151
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:07,100
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

1152
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:09,530
It's large, flat, and gray.

1153
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:12,440
All right,
here I go. Okay?

1154
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:19,250
One, two, three, four.

1155
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:21,410
Okay, charged.

1156
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:25,660
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button

1157
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:28,090
which says "Push to Close."

1158
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,460
Push to close.

1159
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,260
Push it.

1160
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:54,150
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1161
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:55,980
Switch them on.

1162
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,580
Get down now!

1163
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:09,790
You're gonna have to jump.

1164
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:11,960
You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.

1165
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,260
Do what Dr. Grant says!

1166
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:14,680
Let go.
I'll count to three.

1167
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,170
One, two, three!

1168
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:20,760
Four. Five.

1169
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:22,930
I'm coming up to get you.

1170
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,680
I've got to get Tim.

1171
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,430
Okay. I'm gonna
count to three.

1172
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:30,020
One.

1173
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:33,360
Two...

1174
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:45,870
He's not breathing.

1175
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:53,380
I think we're back
in business!

1176
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,970
No!

1177
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:14,810
Mr. Arnold.

1178
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:34,680
Clever girl.

1179
01:45:58,660 --> 01:45:59,960
No, Tim!

1180
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:04,590
Good boy.

1181
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:10,350
Three.

1182
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:16,810
Hello?

1183
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:30,200
Okay. I'm gonna have
to find the others.

1184
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:34,040
Get you to a doctor.

1185
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,370
Lex, you look after Tim.
Yeah.

1186
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,670
Your hair is
all sticking up.

1187
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,920
Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.

1188
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,390
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

1189
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:20,840
Run.

1190
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,290
Just the two Raptors, right?

1191
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,630
You sure the third
one's contained?

1192
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:46,330
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1193
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,780
What is it?

1194
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:16,200
It's a Velociraptor.

1195
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,450
It's inside.

1196
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,600
Follow me.

1197
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:24,220
It's in there.

1198
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:26,100
Control room.

1199
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,320
We can
call for help?

1200
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:35,740
We've got to reboot
the system first.

1201
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,070
The door locks!

1202
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:42,610
Ellie, boot up
the door locks!

1203
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,920
No, boot up
the door locks!

1204
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:57,010
Get back! Boot up
the door locks.

1205
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:58,550
You can't hold it
by yourself!

1206
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,760
It's a UNIX system.
I know this.

1207
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:13,610
It's all the files
of the whole park.

1208
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:17,060
It tells you everything. I've
got to find the right file.

1209
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:18,940
Try to reach the gun.

1210
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:30,040
I can't get it
unless I move.

1211
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:47,590
This is it. This might
be the right file.

1212
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:51,010
This isn't the right file.

1213
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,310
Come on, Lex!

1214
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,070
You got it!
Yes!

1215
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:10,070
Did it!

1216
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,450
Yes!

1217
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:17,130
What works?

1218
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:19,920
All security systems
are enabled. We got it.

1219
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,850
Grant.

1220
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:34,390
Mr. Hammond,
the phones are working.

1221
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:35,770
The children all right?

1222
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:37,570
<i>The children are fine.</i>

1223
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:41,690
Call the mainland. Tell them
to send the damn helicopters.

1224
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:44,030
It's gonna cut
through the glass!

1225
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:37,410
Move!

1226
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:25,460
Tim, let go. Yeah!

1227
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:47,300
After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.

1228
01:57:47,870 --> 01:57:48,960
So have I.

1229
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,350
Come on.
