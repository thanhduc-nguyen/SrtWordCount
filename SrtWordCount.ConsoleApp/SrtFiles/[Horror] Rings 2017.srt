1
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:25,459

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,700
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,340
We are on our final approach
for Seattle.

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,090
The weather is fair,
with winds out of the east.

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,410
The temperature on the ground,
68 degrees.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,010
On behalf of our cabin crew,
and us here on the flight deck,

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,850
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us tonight.

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,330
Life sucks when you can't sleep.

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,650
Yeah, tell me about it.

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,170
Sometimes it's good to talk.

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,930
Okay.

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,850
This is gonna sound crazy,

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,570
but you ever hear about
the videotape that kills you

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,660
after you watch it?

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,730
Well, I'm at this party,

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,170
and I meet this girl
from Seattle.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,970
We totally hit it off.

18
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,930
The next day she sends me this
video that says, "Watch me."

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,440
So, I find a VCR,

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,930
watch it,

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,170
but the images on it...

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,330
The second it was over,
my phone rings.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,570
And this girl says
I'm gonna die in seven days.

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,890
That was a week ago tonight.

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,980
Ever since,
everything's been strange.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,890
All I got to do is make it
through the next five minutes.

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,120
As a reminder...

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,360
God. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,860
Sir! Sir,
please stay in your seat.

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,220
Please remain in your seats
with your seat belts fastened.

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,060
Sir!

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
What was that about?

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,250
That cute guy
sitting right next to us...

34
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,970
It turns out
he's a total head case.

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,730
And he was telling me about a
movie that's supposed to kill you.

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,540
What movie?

37
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,650
Some video.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,040
A chick calls you
on the phone after you watch it

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,200
and says, "Seven days,"

40
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,690
which was, like, right now.

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Open up!

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,890
Did you make a copy of it?

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,740
Did you make a copy of the tape?

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,960
No! I...

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,020
Miss, the seat belt light is on.

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Oh, Jesus.

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,940
What is going on with you?
It's just a story.

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,850
I've seen it!

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,010
Traffic control,
this is Flight 77.

50
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,090
We have some
signal interference.

51
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,900
If you're not interested in
buying, I'd love to take a look.

52
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,250
Sure. I mean,
who would want an old VCR?

53
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,890
Well, once upon a time, this
was a technological revolution.

54
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,600
Okay.

55
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,730
Just talking to the guy.

56
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,010
It turns out that
he got all this stuff from

57
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,370
a family whose son died
in a plane crash a couple of years back.

58
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,810
And now it's just a bunch
of outdated junk.

59
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,210
I prefer "vintage."

60
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,410
Come on, old man.

61
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,730
You still got some life in you.

62
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,120
Hey, Skye?

63
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,370
Guess what.

64
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,570
What?

65
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,130
Had a tape in it.

66
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,250
Care to see
what's down the rabbit hole?

67
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,290
I'm gonna be late for class.

68
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,850
But then, maybe
you can tell me about it later.

69
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,940
Have fun, Professor.

70
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,690
Come on, work.

71
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,560
Hello?

72
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,570
Seven days.

73
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,290
What? Who is this?

74
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,000
Julia.

75
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,810
I keep thinking
about this story.

76
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,730
It's, like, the most romantic
story in the history of stories.

77
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,130
Well, it's not how we met.

78
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,050
No.
It's about this guy, Orpheus.

79
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,680
His girlfriend dies
and he has to literally go down into Hell

80
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,210
to rescue her.

81
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,330
How come it's always the guy
rescuing the girl?

82
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,450
Just...

83
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,850
He tracks her down.
All right? He finds her.

84
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,450
And the Devil's gonna
let her go on one condition.

85
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,730
He has to start first,
without her.

86
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,490
He has to walk away
without looking back at her.

87
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,490
- But...
- He looks back to glimpse her

88
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,810
and loses her forever.
Ninth grade.

89
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,330
- English Lit.
- Okay. You know it.

90
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,250
So, what's your point?

91
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,170
I don't know. I just...

92
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,010
I relate to the guy.

93
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,450
I mean, I can't imagine
not looking back at you.

94
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,690
Actually, you got to go.

95
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,300
Because my boyfriend's
leaving for college,

96
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,610
and I promised
I'd help him pack.

97
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,890
- No!
- Come on, get up.

98
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,650
Baby, baby,
baby, he's a loser. Come back to bed.

99
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,370
Come back to bed, now.

100
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,440
You really need all this?

101
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Yeah.

102
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,290
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

103
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,050
Come on, Holt!

104
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,660
Supposed to be on the road
an hour ago.

105
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,250
Just give us a second, Dad.

106
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,090
You're doing the right thing.

107
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,730
Your mom, she really
needs you right now.

108
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,530
I'm gonna miss your smell.

109
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,930
Really?

110
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,280
Yeah.

111
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,170
Okay.

112
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,850
I'll see you
Columbus Day weekend.

113
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,770
And tell Tommy Lombardi
that I'm on to him.

114
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,970
What do you mean?

115
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,290
He gets a job where you work
the day I leave?

116
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,250
You're crazy!

117
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,530
Don't look back!

118
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,860
9:30, Skype, tonight!

119
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,130
Where the hell is your shirt?

120
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
Tonight!

121
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,370
And every night!

122
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
And every single night!

123
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,130
Unless I'm with Tommy Lombardi!

124
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,490
You did not just say that!

125
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh, baby,
it's been six weeks. I can't take it.

126
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,730
Why are you so much nicer now

127
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,890
that we don't live
in the same town?

128
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,010
Sorry, what's your name again?

129
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,010
- Shut up.
- That's a weird name.

130
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,730
How are your classes?

131
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,250
Kind of uninspiring.

132
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,570
There's this
one Experimental Biology class, though.

133
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,900
The teacher's kind of a badass.

134
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,810
That sounds cool.

135
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,450
Yeah.

136
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,290
Not everything's cool, though.

137
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,760
It's still, like,
a whole week until I get to see you.

138
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,810
Well, you're seeing me now.

139
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,810
Yeah, I guess.

140
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,650
What about I start
by taking off my hairclip?

141
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,850
Oh!

142
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,010
Yeah. Uh, okay.

143
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,890
What's next?

144
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,060
"Oh, take me, take me.
I can't stand it!"

145
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,420
How did you even get in here?

146
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,170
These idiots just
broke into my room.

147
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,290
Come on, Vision Quest.
Gabriel says you're up.

148
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,410
Let's go to the 7s.

149
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,370
- Shit. Tonight?
- Tonight.

150
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,760
Sorry, little lady,
but boyfriend's got plans tonight.

151
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,820
You know, but we could talk.

152
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,170
I think I'm good.

153
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,580
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

154
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,780
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- He'll talk to you...

155
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,250
Yeah, sure.

156
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,810
I told you
I'd make it up to you.

157
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,450
Julia...

158
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,810
You owe me a good dream.

159
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,010
- Where is he?
- Who are you?

160
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Where's Holt?

161
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,700
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to him in days.

162
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Don't lie to me!

163
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm not lying to you!

164
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,500
What are you
doing on his computer?

165
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,040
Tell him there's no hiding.
Tell the dead man he can't hide.

166
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,890
What... What are you talking
about? What's wrong with you?

167
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,170
She's coming.

168
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,970
There's no stopping her.

169
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Tell Holt that...

170
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,770
Please pick up the phone.

171
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,100
This is Holt.
You know what to...

172
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,620
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

173
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,380
Holt, what's going on?

174
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,490
I just had the strangest
conversation in my life

175
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,770
with that weird girl.

176
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,220
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

177
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,010
Hello?

178
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,530
Science has told us
that we are merely

179
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,560
the primal stirrings of
some carbon, some proteins.

180
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,370
We live a while, eat,

181
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,600
have sex, when we can.

182
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,530
And that's it, then we die.

183
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,600
Lewin, there's no need
to take notes on that part.

184
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,570
But wait, hold on,

185
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,250
because no one is denying
that we have consciousness.

186
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,000
Some inner life
that's not quite accounted for here.

187
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,850
Let's remember the infamous
double-slit experiment.

188
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,610
When no one is watching,

189
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,320
the particles just pass
through both slits at the same time.

190
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,530
But with an observer,
they behave like bullets,

191
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,930
passing through
one slit or the other.

192
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,490
This is big, guys.

193
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,330
The immaterial
human consciousness

194
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,050
has reached out
and touched the material.

195
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,690
There is a calculable
transformation in the real world,

196
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,570
and solely because

197
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,330
someone was there to watch it.

198
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,130
Which may account for the fact

199
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,050
that I have become
significantly sweatier once I've noticed

200
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,650
the mysterious stranger watching
me from the back of the room.

201
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,570
All right, that's it.
Go get drunk.

202
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,850
Hey, I remember you guys from...

203
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,460
- Why'd you come here?
- Come on, dude.

204
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,250
Move it along. There you go.
There you go.

205
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,800
How can I help you?

206
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,850
I'm looking for my boyfriend.

207
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,330
He's supposed to
be in your class.

208
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,330
Okay.
What's this guy's name?

209
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,850
Holt Anthony.

210
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,450
Yeah.

211
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,930
Not sure.

212
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,300
It always takes me
until Thanksgiving

213
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,410
to start putting names to faces.

214
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,090
Really? 'Cause

215
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,650
he was supposed to do some sort
of extra credit thing for you.

216
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,380
Did he?

217
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,850
Maybe. I don't know.

218
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,930
I do know that
I have 25 essays to grade.

219
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,210
Listen. Okay.

220
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,610
It's not uncommon for a new
student to find something or someone

221
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,410
that's more interesting
to them than class.

222
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,370
My advice to you?
Move on.

223
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,460
Calm down.

224
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,780
I'm telling you, it's different.

225
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,690
Everyone says that.
It's okay. Where's your tail?

226
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,490
I don't have one anymore.

227
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,900
I told you not to call him.

228
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,970
That asshole hung up on me!

229
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,450
I wonder why.

230
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,730
Okay. We'll switch tails.
You talk to Holt?

231
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,930
No! I tried.
He isn't answering his phone.

232
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,690
- Come on.
- Holt has his own problems.

233
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,290
You have to help me, Gabriel.

234
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,500
It's your fault!
You started this!

235
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,690
Calm down.

236
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,280
Listen to me, Gabe!

237
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,530
The videos,
the tails, all these people.

238
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,490
- It's wrong and she's pissed!
- You're being ridiculous.

239
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,210
I can feel her.
It's all changing.

240
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,450
You don't have much time.
You need to trust me.

241
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,130
How could I ever trust you?

242
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,180
Get to your studio.
Don't talk to anyone along the way.

243
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,770
Make a copy of
the video and wait.

244
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,930
I'm gonna send
someone right now. Hey, hey, hey!

245
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,330
Everything's gonna
be fine, darling. You understand?

246
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,850
Yes! I understand!

247
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,850
But you don't.

248
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,330
I honestly didn't find the
tape to be that scary, but...

249
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,930
Oh. Hey, you're not
supposed to be here!

250
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,200
Hey!

251
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,250
You called me the other night.

252
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,930
Hey! Look at me.

253
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,410
You're the girlfriend.

254
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,930
Where's Holt?

255
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,690
I... I can help you.

256
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,850
But I need to show you
something first.

257
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,050
You live here?

258
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,970
Yeah. Fine Arts.
Grad program.

259
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,810
I need a clear head
to do my work, and I like my privacy.

260
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,490
Is Holt even here?

261
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,730
Did I say he would be?

262
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,140
Be careful where you step.
I just painted the ceiling.

263
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,250
Nothing's wrong.
He's not avoiding you.

264
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,890
He's just on a journey.

265
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,060
I want you to watch something
and then you'll understand.

266
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,210
- Is that my phone?
- You're lying!

267
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,810
I need you to do this for me.

268
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,810
It's just a two-minute video.
It won't hurt you.

269
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,840
Open the door!

270
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,090
Julia! I need you to help me.

271
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,290
Holt watched it.
We've all watched it.

272
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,370
Open the door!

273
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,330
You're not real.

274
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,930
You're not real!

275
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,530
7:10.

276
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,050
I win, bitch.

277
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Jules!

278
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,810
What happened?
What happened?

279
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,730
Tell me you didn't watch it.
Tell me!

280
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,120
She's dead.
She's dead. She's dead.

281
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,810
Hello?

282
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,650
Uh... Gabriel sent me.

283
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,450
I'm supposed to watch a video.

284
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,330
Hello.

285
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,130
Gabriel. Gabriel.

286
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,320
Do you know about Skye?

287
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,050
I know.
Someone put a picture of her online.

288
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,690
Everyone's dropping out.

289
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,290
Wait.

290
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,450
Wait.
Do I still have a tail?

291
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,170
Gabriel?

292
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,380
Is someone still
watching for me?

293
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm gonna find you someone,
I promise you that.

294
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,930
Just stay where you are.

295
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,170
Who was that?

296
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,130
It was Gabriel.

297
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,050
Everything's gonna be fine.

298
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,970
That's what he told Skye.

299
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,450
Listen, Julia.

300
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,970
I'm really sorry that
you had to see that.

301
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,890
But I can't let you
get caught up in this.

302
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,970
I think it's a little
too late for that.

303
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,570
I watched it.

304
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,490
Twelve hours after Skye.

305
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,650
We were supposed to
help each other through it.

306
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,960
"Help each other"?

307
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,970
Yeah.

308
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,850
- So were you and her...
- No.

309
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,370
Gabriel said a few of us were gonna be
chosen for this experiment.

310
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,640
If you just heard
the way he described it.

311
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,650
That we could prove
the existence of a soul.

312
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,370
Of life after death.

313
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,250
I know.
I know. It sounds crazy,

314
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,530
but I'm just...

315
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,210
The tape is the doorway
to the other side.

316
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,770
Then why did she die?

317
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,730
You have seven days
before you die.

318
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,770
You just have
to watch the tape and make a copy,

319
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
and show it to someone else.

320
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,370
And then you're fine.

321
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,610
Gabriel calls it a "tail."

322
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,450
Her tail just didn't show.

323
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,850
So were you
supposed to pass on a death sentence

324
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,970
to someone else?

325
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,330
How could you get
involved in this?

326
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
Please.

327
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,090
Whatever you are,

328
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,930
leave him alone.

329
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,370
Seven days.

330
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,290
Jules. What did you do?

331
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,770
I saw something.

332
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,370
There was a room. A door.

333
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,170
Yeah.

334
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,730
It's Gabriel.

335
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,930
Holt, listen.
I've got a tail for you.

336
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,610
It's not for me anymore.

337
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,800
You know why I wasn't
answering your calls, right?

338
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,290
It was to protect you from this.

339
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,890
Gabriel had a solution for me.

340
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,890
It would have been fine.
I would have been fine.

341
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,970
Then I'll be fine, too.

342
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,690
Jules!

343
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,680
What happened?

344
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,130
A bird.

345
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,930
There was a bird.

346
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,810
Julia!

347
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,890
See? I told you
there was a bird.

348
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,730
Julia!

349
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,850
But I saw it.

350
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,250
So you watched the tape.

351
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,050
And I had
dismissed self-sacrifice as popular myth.

352
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,890
Holt was running out of time.

353
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,410
It was the only way to save him.

354
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,570
Anyone would have done it.

355
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,410
You know,
I could show you some research

356
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,530
that would suggest the opposite.

357
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,930
She's marked already.

358
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,770
On day one.

359
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,850
And it's... It's different.

360
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,130
I wasn't marked until day five.

361
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,370
Gabriel,
this has to mean something.

362
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,410
It's happening faster.

363
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,610
Maybe it is all changing.

364
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,600
I wanted to believe that tape
meant a lot of things.

365
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,530
That our souls are eternal,

366
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,450
and when we die,

367
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,010
the spirit strives
to find a new home.

368
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,970
Then I saw the picture.

369
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,930
I saw Skye's face.

370
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,050
You saw it, too.

371
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,760
You want to survive, you make a
copy and you show someone.

372
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,290
No one is dying because of me.

373
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,690
I'll tell them how it works.

374
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,970
And so what?
The cycle just continues?

375
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,650
What do you think survival is?

376
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Just make a copy.

377
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,810
We'll decide what
to do with it later.

378
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,960
Please.

379
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

380
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,330
What did you do here?

381
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,890
Uh, her version won't copy.

382
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,890
What do you mean
"it won't copy"?

383
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,090
Your file size is
larger than the original.

384
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,890
How can that be?

385
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,730
Scrub through her copy.

386
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,610
Ooh, what is that?
Go back.

387
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,690
Right there!

388
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,060
The bird.

389
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,330
I told you in the car
I saw that bird.

390
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,650
What?

391
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,090
It shouldn't be there.

392
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,250
I need my equipment.

393
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,050
Okay. See, there's these
weird gaps in the digital code.

394
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,370
Glitches where we get
these ghost images, like your bird.

395
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,290
I mean, we're talking
one or two frame still images,

396
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,450
but there's more.

397
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,770
There's video data condensed
in the still frames.

398
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,130
A video within the video?

399
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,130
Well, there is now.

400
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,370
I don't want you to watch it.

401
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,050
Jules, there's no way.

402
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,850
We're watching this together.
End of discussion.

403
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,490
Holt, whatever it is,
I think it's intended for Julia alone.

404
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,090
Look at me.

405
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,130
I know you're upset
that I watched it.

406
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,770
But we can't let it be
for nothing.

407
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,610
So don't look back, okay?

408
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,850
Put it on.

409
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,580
Jules?

410
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,490
Baby, tell us what you see.

411
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,570
A clock.

412
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,170
A cross in a flood.

413
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,930
A girl.

414
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,410
Jules.

415
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,920
Jules?

416
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,770
I don't know.

417
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,770
A burning body.

418
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,440
Jules!

419
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,410
Sorry. I, um...

420
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,130
What was it?

421
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,530
Only images,
but I can't explain how it felt.

422
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,970
Flood.
Fire. Cremation.

423
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,050
Those are images
that have never been on the tape before.

424
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,690
You know,
primitive cultures believed

425
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,450
that the only way to free a soul

426
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,090
is to burn the body.

427
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,130
That is, if you can find it.

428
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,440
Wait.

429
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,330
I saw this.

430
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,450
That's where they buried her.

431
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,170
I traced it to a town
called Sacrament Valley,

432
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,210
about four hours from here.

433
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,810
That's where we need to go.

434
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,730
Hello.

435
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,900
Ah. Thank you, Jamal.

436
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,090
The police are
on their way here.

437
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,930
And you're not
even coming with us!

438
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,370
The police want to
ask me questions, Holt.

439
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,890
They think you killed Skye.

440
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,980
But you didn't.

441
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,290
I hope if you learn
anything from an education,

442
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,250
it's that more than
one theory can be true.

443
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,650
I didn't kill Skye.

444
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,050
And I did.

445
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,330
But the cops don't deal
in such ambiguities.

446
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,650
My research.

447
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,770
Everything that's known
about the tape is in there.

448
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,010
It'll be more of a help to you
than I can be.

449
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,530
A man never quite
measures up to his work.

450
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,930
The images on the tape,
they were her story.

451
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,090
She wanted it to be heard.

452
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,650
"Samara was found abandoned
as a young child.

453
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,560
"No one knew where she came
from or who her parents were.

454
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,690
"She was adopted,
and they realized

455
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,580
"that something was unnatural
about this girl.

456
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,290
"Something evil.

457
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,490
"They tried to kill her,

458
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,250
"but Samara survived for seven
days at the bottom of the well.

459
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,530
"They found her body
years later."

460
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,890
And they brought her
all the way to this town?

461
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,200
Why?

462
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,730
I don't know.

463
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
That girl.

464
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,810
What girl?

465
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,890
Hello?

466
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,210
Hello?

467
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,250
Can I help you?

468
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,370
Hey, uh...

469
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,530
There was no light outside.
Do you have any vacancies?

470
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,290
Two rooms?

471
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,740
One.

472
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,650
Cash only.
Checkout's at noon.

473
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,250
It's an old house.

474
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,730
Walls are thin.

475
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,890
Hope you don't mind the cats.

476
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,720
I'm just down the hall.

477
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,690
Excuse me.
Who's the girl in this photo?

478
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,890
The one in the middle there?

479
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,530
Why, that's my niece.

480
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,890
Beautiful, isn't she?
People say we look just...

481
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,890
No, I'm sorry.
I meant the girl with the violin.

482
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,540
Oh. That's Evelyn.

483
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,340
I think I saw her.

484
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,850
Earlier today.

485
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,170
That's not possible.

486
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,610
She disappeared 30 years ago.

487
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,530
Does anyone know why?

488
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,330
No.

489
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,250
And I'd rather
not talk about it.

490
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,530
Ma'am, where's the church?

491
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,410
Well, it's not a church anymore.

492
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,850
That's when I hit rock bottom.

493
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,650
I guess the worst part of it
for me was that I let down my kids,

494
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,740
I let down my husband.

495
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,610
Raise your hand
if life ever let you down.

496
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,410
Go ahead now, raise your hand.

497
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,650
And then you found the drug
that you thought unlocked a secret.

498
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,730
One day at a time.

499
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,690
Thank you all for coming.

500
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,650
I'll see you next week.

501
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,370
Jules. We better go.

502
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,010
So, what do we do now?

503
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,680
Awful young to be here.
Don't let it kill you.

504
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,850
Excuse me, sir!

505
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,610
Could you tell me
a little bit more about the church?

506
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,010
When did it close?

507
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,530
Been 13 years.

508
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,090
After the flood.

509
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,210
Town used to have five times
this many people.

510
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,880
Ever since,

511
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,610
there's more dead
than alive around here.

512
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Thank you.

513
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,940
He said the church was...

514
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,450
That's where they brought her.

515
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,080
The cemetery.

516
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,410
Look for her name.

517
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,860
Come on, pick up.

518
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,770
This is Holt.
You know what to do.

519
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,570
Holt, it's Gabriel.

520
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,940
I don't know if you're getting
these messages,

521
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,810
but I figured out
the mark on Julia's hand.

522
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,570
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

523
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:44,160
"The waters rose to carry them
and brought them back safely to God."

524
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,780
Holt!

525
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,360
Holt!

526
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,410
Hey, hey, hey.

527
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,450
She's in there.

528
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,770
Someone moved her.

529
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,530
Jules?

530
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,090
What are you doing?

531
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,370
There's writing.

532
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,290
Holt.

533
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,130
Holt!

534
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,450
Julia!

535
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,020
Hey, what happened?
What happened?

536
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,490
What happened?

537
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,690
I saw something.

538
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,530
The well.

539
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

540
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,650
We were just looking...

541
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,050
I know who you're looking for.

542
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,200
Let's go.

543
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,130
- What did you find?
- Two kids.

544
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,570
Caught them breaking into 294.

545
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,890
Breaking in?

546
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,450
Well, that's new.

547
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,300
You want me to
take them down to the Sheriff's Office?

548
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,490
No, no, no, no, no,
don't bother the Sheriff.

549
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,090
I can take care of this.

550
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,090
I'm Galen Burke.

551
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,890
I watch over things here.

552
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,010
So to speak.

553
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,290
Please. Come in.

554
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,570
It's not much.

555
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,080
But I wasn't expecting company.

556
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,100
- I can... I can take...
- No, no. I'm fine, son.

557
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,610
I know every corner
of this house.

558
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,140
So,

559
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,890
you're looking for the girl.

560
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,250
I find it interesting

561
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:47,050
that you managed
to find her grave

562
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,410
even after
the marker was removed.

563
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,840
I had a vision.

564
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,730
An image of that grave
that led me here.

565
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,930
And inside the grave,

566
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,290
I saw a vision of a well.

567
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,130
A vision.

568
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,130
So, you want to know
about Samara Morgan.

569
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,960
Our priest was very active
with the community back then.

570
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,680
He heard that after
all the little girl had been through

571
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:36,290
that she was being denied
a resting place.

572
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,570
Well, who's to say that charity isn't
meant for the dead?

573
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,170
So why isn't she there now?

574
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,480
Well, because we paid
mightily for this act of charity.

575
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,920
It was as if God and nature
itself wanted us to be rid of her.

576
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,240
The flood.

577
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,400
Yes.

578
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,730
But I had let myself believe,

579
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,770
like you,

580
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,280
that she was trying
to tell me something.

581
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,290
I was pulled to that grave.

582
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,600
She showed me things.

583
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,770
Things that no one
should have to imagine.

584
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,090
And then I went blind.

585
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,980
I'm so sorry.

586
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,570
No, don't be.

587
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,410
It brought me peace.

588
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,120
The priest requested
that her body be moved.

589
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,370
He left Sacrament Valley.

590
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:48,770
She was buried in
a potter's field just north of town,

591
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,930
to be forgotten by all.

592
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,090
I think we should
get out of here.

593
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,450
Listen to me.

594
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,290
There is nothing about that girl

595
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,250
that's worth
being curious about.

596
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,690
I need to see this through.

597
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,050
Why?

598
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,540
Because you think
you were chosen for something?

599
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,610
Having a vision

600
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,370
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

601
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,210
Thank you.

602
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,450
What's this on your hand?

603
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,980
Why did you put this mark
on your hand?

604
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,850
What do you mean?

605
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,880
Be careful.

606
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,000
You hear me?

607
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:56,440
So, what now?

608
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,810
We gotta find the body.

609
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,650
What?

610
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,210
Hey, stay right there.

611
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,650
This road's closed.
There's been an accident.

612
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,690
- Need you to turn it around.
- Okay, sir.

613
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,330
- Julia!
- It's that girl.

614
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,730
From the picture.

615
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,140
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going, sir?

616
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,610
Excuse me. Turn around.

617
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,650
Stop!

618
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,360
Evelyn!

619
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,280
Stop!

620
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,080
Gabriel?

621
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,740
Oh, Gabriel.

622
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,080
Over here!

623
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,420
- He needs help!
- Hey!

624
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:18,420
Gabriel.

625
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,170
What is it?

626
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,730
Hey, sir! Please!

627
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,250
Gabriel, tell me.

628
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,770
You can't be down there!

629
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,460
Julia!

630
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,930
He was coming for a reason.

631
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,210
He wanted to tell us something.

632
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,890
No, she wanted to
tell us something.

633
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,690
This girl has something
to do with Samara.

634
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,490
We need to go back.

635
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:52,450
I can feel her pain,
her suffering.

636
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,820
I'm sick with it
and it's getting worse.

637
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,810
I'm so tired.

638
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,250
Then you sleep.

639
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,490
I'm gonna get us
something to eat.

640
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,720
Okay.

641
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,240
Look.

642
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,170
We'll figure this out.

643
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,730
I was right there.

644
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,720
There you go, Karen.

645
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,730
Chicken fried steak and coffee.

646
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:12,960
Hey. Menu?

647
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,570
Yeah. Sure.

648
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,970
So, what is that?
Chicken or steak?

649
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,130
You're funny.

650
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,490
Look, I...

651
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:34,650
I don't mean to
be rude, but, uh...

652
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,610
The girl who's friends with your
niece, the one who disappeared...

653
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,570
Can you tell me
a little bit more about what happened?

654
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,370
My niece and she

655
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,890
knew each other through
the church music program.

656
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,970
But she was the most gifted.

657
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,530
People used to kid her,
"You're too good for this place.

658
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:13,490
"We're gonna wake up one day
and you'll be gone, and that'll be that."

659
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,170
I guess there's certain jokes
you shouldn't make

660
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,650
because it happened.

661
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,890
She disappeared.

662
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,650
No clothes gone. No note.

663
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:27,300
Just vanished.

664
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,100
Ah!

665
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:34,970
The priest.

666
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,930
He kept you down here.

667
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,370
The child!

668
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,410
Thirty-four weeks.

669
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,690
Eight and a half months.

670
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,250
You were pregnant.

671
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,610
You were Samara's mother.

672
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,330
The police investigated
for six months,

673
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,170
and then we stopped
hearing from them.

674
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,010
Town never felt
quite the same after that.

675
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,930
The priest.

676
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,740
Do you know
what happened to him?

677
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,490
He still lives in town.

678
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,010
Although he isn't
a priest anymore.

679
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,770
Not since he went blind.

680
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,010
I have to go.
Uh, excuse me.

681
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,960
Mr. Burke!

682
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,690
It's Julia!
I have to talk to you!

683
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,130
The boy's not with you.

684
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,960
What's wrong?

685
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,450
I think I understand my visions.

686
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,560
The things
she's been showing me.

687
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,370
I need to know about the priest.

688
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,850
I guess, just like
most people in the town,

689
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:54,970
the event sort of
took it out of him.

690
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,530
I just don't see why it matters.

691
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,410
There was a girl
here 30 years ago who disappeared.

692
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,290
I've seen her.

693
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:05,880
Evelyn Borden.

694
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,770
You knew her?

695
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,690
Everyone knew Evelyn.

696
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,490
She was kept under the church.

697
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:18,490
I found a room.
It was like a prison.

698
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,080
There were days
marked off on the walls.

699
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,450
Nine months.

700
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,250
She's Samara's mother.

701
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,810
She suffered from
the day she was born.

702
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,850
And she's still suffering now.

703
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,570
I think I understand it.

704
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,850
This curse. This.

705
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:40,570
It will never stop
until she's free.

706
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,050
What's that sound?

707
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,970
Cicadas.

708
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,760
Burke.

709
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,530
Jules?

710
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:47,840
Jules!

711
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,520
Julia...

712
01:20:55,940 --> 01:21:00,850
I know what it's like
to be guided by visions.

713
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,050
To be certain.

714
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,810
I was certain
that I would father

715
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,210
a child that
was gonna change the world.

716
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,050
And I was right.

717
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,730
You see, Julia,

718
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,250
she didn't take my sight.

719
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,640
I did.

720
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:43,730
Good girl.

721
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,250
You're very brave.

722
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,450
You're Samara's father.

723
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,730
You kidnapped Evelyn.

724
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:54,320
The night that I laid with her,

725
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,010
I heard them.

726
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,340
The cicadas.

727
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:00,020
You moved her bones
and she's still your prisoner.

728
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:02,970
As are you.

729
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,850
Ah!

730
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,610
You think that
you're the first Good Samaritan

731
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,260
that she cried
out to, to free her?

732
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,570
You're the 12th, Julia.

733
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,380
Though none of
the others got this far.

734
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:16,050
You think that
you're so close to bringing her peace.

735
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:20,450
But you have no idea the hell that you
would unleash on the world.

736
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,010
Julia?

737
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:33,930
Samara can't hurt me,
because I can't see her.

738
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,650
But you, Julia,

739
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,210
I can hear your every breath!

740
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,970
You will

741
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:24,890
not set her free!

742
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,400
Julia,

743
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,810
you remind me of Evelyn.

744
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,330
I chained Evelyn's hands

745
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:44,040
because she was
trying to kill our child.

746
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,970
I should have let her!

747
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,730
She was your daughter!

748
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,770
What are you trying to show me?

749
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:12,980
No.

750
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:45,690
Samara.

751
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,530
You're here.

752
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,300
Julia?

753
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,650
Here she is, Samara!

754
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:45,090
This is what
becomes of your savior!

755
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:50,450
With the grace of
the Holy Spirit,

756
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,410
may the Lord who
freed you from sin

757
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,560
save you,

758
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:00,250
and raise you up!

759
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,130
Julia...

760
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,010
Don't leave me.

761
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,650
from sin!

762
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,890
May the Lord save you!

763
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:53,810
Through this holy anointing...

764
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,800
Who's there?

765
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,810
Samara.

766
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,570
Hey. It's okay.

767
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,730
It's over.

768
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:35,560
It's over.

769
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,210
Not yet.

770
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:57,210
What could that have felt like?

771
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,930
To be feared by everyone
who's supposed to love you.

772
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:04,610
Not everyone.

773
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,090
You were never afraid of her.

774
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,970
You're free, Samara.

775
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,460
Holt. It's Gabriel.

776
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,820
I don't know if you're getting
these messages,

777
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,610
but I figured out the mark
on Julia's hand.

778
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,730
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

779
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,170
Our souls are eternal,

780
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,330
and when we die,

781
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:05,930
the spirit strives
to find a new home.

782
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,800
I'm telling you,
she's coming back.

783
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,250
This time for real.

784
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,810
You were never afraid of her.

785
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,890
Just because you had a vision

786
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,660
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

787
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:34,890
You have no idea

788
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,370
the hell that you would
unleash on the world.

789
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,850
And I'm sorry.

790
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,170
It won't stop.

791
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,860
No, no.

792
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:55,970
What?

793
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,170
No, no, no!

794
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,880
Stop!

795
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,170
Come on!

796
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,250
Julia!
