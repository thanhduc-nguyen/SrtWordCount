1
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,535
I can't hold her much longer, Murphy.

2
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,373
Port bow is heeling.

3
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,867
She's taking on too much water.

4
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,369
What is going on back there?

5
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,996
Keep your pants on, Murphy.

6
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,340
Damn, Murphy, we blew
the starboard engine.

7
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,838
Port engine's running way too hot.

8
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,181
- Hold on.
- Shorten the tow.

9
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,184
Cut her loose.

10
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,432
Epps, get off my damn tugboat.

11
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,645
We don't have much time.

12
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,936
Move it, epps. Move it!

13
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,855
If she sinks, she's taking us with her.

14
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,152
Got a punch in the port floater.

15
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,074
I'll give it minutes before she floods.

16
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,242
You got less than that!

17
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,080
Get back here.

18
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,995
We're cutting her loose.

19
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:18,992
Cut her loose, Murphy.

20
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,665
That's it. Now, get back here.

21
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,879
Come on, epps! You heard the man!

22
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,124
Took us three months to
get her off the bottom.

23
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,091
I will not lose her now!

24
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,794
Goddamn it, epps!

25
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,218
You can't fix everything!

26
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,225
= Christ!

27
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,107
I'm telling you for the
last time, get back here!

28
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,691
She's taking on too much water!

29
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,522
Why do you always
have to break my balls?

30
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,568
I said get back here!

31
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,331
Do you want me to come down
there and kick your ass?

32
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,495
"Cause I'll do it.

33
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,003
Well, here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

34
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,753
Yeah, we did it, guys!

35
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,971
Yeah, look at that!

36
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,090
All right! Nice work!

37
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,474
Here's to the fucking sea!

38
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:25,442
To the sea.

39
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,819
To a job well done.

40
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,108
Hi. Hi, Mr. Murphy?

41
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,946
I'm Jack ferriman.

42
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,033
I was wondering if I
could buy you a drink.

43
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,036
He doesn't drink.

44
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,208
Okay, think I talk
to you alone for a sec?

45
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,668
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.

46
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,707
That's the way it is.

47
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,837
Okay, I fly the arctic
weather patrol flights

48
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,755
out of MacKenzie bay. - Yeah?

49
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,880
And last month, I was out
in the middle of the strait

50
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,506
when I came across this.

51
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,682
Congratulations, you found a boat,

52
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,397
in the middle of the ocean, of all places.

53
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,437
Well, I did three flybys

54
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,355
and tried for radio
contact and got nothing,

55
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,978
so I figured she had to be adrift.

56
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,780
This was in the Bering strait?

57
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:13,614
Yeah.

58
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,404
That's 1000 miles from
the nearest shipping lanes.

59
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,027
Why didn't you alert the coast guard?

60
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,869
I did, but it's international waters,

61
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,829
so they noted it and that's it.

62
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,825
You get a name off this boat?

63
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,794
No, I put it out of my head
until about two days ago,

64
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,797
and I saw it again.

65
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,921
What are we talking about here?

66
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,166
What kind of tonnage is it?

67
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,216
Big, huge, could be military.

68
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,090
Okay, let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

69
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,429
What's your end?

70
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,847
What's in it for you?

71
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,813
I want 20% % finder's
fee, whatever she's worth.

72
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,233
Have you told anyone else about this?

73
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,851
Not a living soul.

74
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,481
Give us a minute, will you?

75
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,492
Okay.

76
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,235
So? What do you think, murph?

77
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,988
Who knows?

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,786
Could be full of shit.

79
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,283
I do know one thing.

80
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,128
I've seen strange things
happen in the strait.

81
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,086
I know something else.

82
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,456
If the sea gives you an
opportunity, you take it.

83
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,505
That's at least a week
out of our way, Murphy.

84
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,345
I mean, we've been out
for six months already.

85
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,509
I got my fiance waiting, remember?

86
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,224
I mean, I'm getting married in a month.

87
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,093
The plan was to go back to Anchorage.

88
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,471
Starboard diesel needs a total overhaul.

89
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,225
In our business, the only plan is...

90
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,271
There is no plan.

91
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,520
Listen, of you don't want
to go, that's fine with me.

92
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,567
Let's just tell him
we'll get somebody else.

93
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,530
No big deal.

94
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,195
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

95
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,909
Let's not be hasty.

96
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,370
What do you think a ship
like that could be worth?

97
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,159
Who knows?

98
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,249
Millions? Thousands?

99
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,207
Could be worth nothing.

100
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,873
Depends on a lot of things.

101
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,462
Mainly, if we have the
right to salvage it.

102
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,797
That's a pretty big "if."

103
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,801
What's the split?

104
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,093
We split it even, six ways.

105
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,052
Even split?

106
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,798
Uh-huh, beats
me paying you overtime.

107
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,017
I'm good.

108
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,385
I'm in.

109
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,646
Greer? What do you say?

110
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,443
All right.

111
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,275
Hey, ferryman! Can you come over here?

112
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,282
Oi.

113
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,534
Okay, so this is the way it works.

114
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:26,453
10% 9% instead of your
20% 79% finder's fee.

115
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,788
I'm sorry, I can't let you
take advantage of me like that.

116
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,959
That's the way it is.

117
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,967
Take it or leave it.

118
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,765
Fine. But I go with you.

119
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,644
Not on my boat, you don't.

120
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,184
Look, I mean, do you
think I'm stupid enough

121
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,024
to tell you where a fortune
might be without some insurance?

122
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,892
There's five other
salvage boats on this dock

123
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,610
that would jump at what I got.

124
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,105
I come with you, so you
"take it or leave it."

125
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,189
Ow! Those things are dull!

126
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,694
Gonna love it. What do you think?

127
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,823
I think you took a little
too much off the sides,

128
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,613
but I think I can come up
with something she'll love.

129
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,077
Shave that yourself.

130
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,160
You sure you
don't want to help me out?

131
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,497
Who the fuck are you kidding, greer?

132
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,037
Everybody knows you Navy
boys take it up the ass.

133
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,355
Enjoying the ride, Jack?

134
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,396
No, sir.

135
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,246
Not the same as flying weather planes

136
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,491
over ice sheets, is it?

137
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,292
What's the appeal?

138
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,126
I could ask you the same thing.

139
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,995
You mean, "what's a
nice girl doing like me

140
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,714
doing in a dump like this
instead of raising a family?"

141
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,210
Simple, I own a third
of Murphy's operation.

142
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,712
I'm not that nice.

143
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,509
And these monkeys are my family.

144
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,762
Santos to Murphy, come in.

145
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,148
- Yep?
- Yo, murph,

146
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,233
I think you should get up here.

147
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,443
What is it?

148
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,437
I think you should see this!

149
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,987
Not a damn thing was
there a second ago, man!

150
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:07,825
10 miles to the northwest.

151
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,115
Would you turn off that fucking music?

152
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,205
Man, I'm telling you,

153
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,949
there must be some kind of
glitch with the machine.

154
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,791
It was there a second ago.

155
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,625
I saw it with my own eyes.
Glitch, my ass.

156
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,210
There's nothing there.

157
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,499
Give me a look at this thing.

158
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,090
There! Take a look!

159
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,004
There it is! Right in front of you!

160
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:24,842
Okay?

161
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:25,631
View it with our own eyes,

162
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,998
and tell me you don't see nothing.

163
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,720
Huh? Do you see what I'm saying?

164
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,807
Can't you see what I'm saying to you?

165
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,846
Dodge, could you get on the bow light?

166
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,937
All right, murph.

167
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,987
It's there, right?

168
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,151
There's something there.

169
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,164
Hey, murph, what's up?

170
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,083
Vessel at position seven-five north.

171
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,455
This is arctic warrior.

172
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,219
Come in.

173
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,135
This is tugboat arctic
warrior, do you read me?

174
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,680
This is arctic warrior.

175
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,971
Do you read me? Come in.

176
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,993
= shit!

177
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,111
Huh? Now do you believe me?

178
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Holy shit!

179
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,197
An ocean liner?

180
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,240
Where did that come from?

181
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,163
The antonia graza.

182
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,752
Jesus Christ.

183
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,254
This is civilian tugboat arctic warrior.

184
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,005
Is there anyone aboard?

185
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,052
This is civilian tugboat arctic warrior.

186
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:37,978
Is anyone aboard?

187
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,936
This is arctic warrior. Can you read us?

188
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,692
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.

189
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,453
Christ, she's beautiful.

190
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,200
These Italian liners, they
couldn't compete for speed,

191
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,452
so they built floating
art palaces instead.

192
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,875
She was reported missing
on the 21st of may, 1962,

193
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,172
somewhere off the coast of labrador.

194
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,387
Funny thing is, there
was no distress signal,

195
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,800
no contact, she just disappeared.

196
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,808
She was gone.

197
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,765
So ever since that day,

198
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,226
every captain and his
mother's been looking for her,

199
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,561
hoping she hasn't gone down.

200
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:25,939
Do you know what this means?

201
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,943
What?

202
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,232
It means, under the law
of the sea, she's ours.

203
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,322
Let's not keep a lady waiting, guys.

204
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,533
Santos, bring us alongside.

205
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,446
Greer, fire up the crane.

206
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,489
We got business to do.

207
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,955
Okay, when we get on board, stay together.

208
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,121
We don't know what kind
of shape she's in, okay?

209
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,618
Take us up, greer.

210
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,245
Aye, aye, captain.

211
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,086
Hey, Murphy, please remember
to keep all channels open.

212
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,093
Thank you.

213
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,348
They won't let me go.

214
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,842
Safety first.

215
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,263
That's why you go last, Jack.

216
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,762
Can you sit down, please?

217
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,935
I'm trying to keep this thing steady.

218
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,898
I just want... = sit down!

219
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,017
Get out of the way, man!

220
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,484
Get out of the way!

221
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,523
Okay. Fuck.

222
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,487
She's had some battering
over the last 40 years,

223
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,780
you can tell that.

224
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,777
Stand by, murph.

225
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,995
Setting you down topside.

226
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,074
Wow, she's still a beaut, eh?

227
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,213
= unbelievable.

228
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,960
Okay, guys,
you better stay alert.

229
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,253
Watch your step.

230
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,549
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

231
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,762
We'll make our way in at the fore,

232
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,505
then check the bridge, okay?

233
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,178
This way. Be careful now.

234
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,141
Forward mast is history.

235
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,763
Epps and Murphy, are
they a couple or just...

236
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,391
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.

237
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,609
He'd be lost without her.

238
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,691
Well, the
superstructure's in decent shape.

239
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,781
No sign of damage here.

240
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,991
Lifeboats
are gone, stern to bow.

241
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,443
I see the life
preserver lockers are all empty.

242
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,707
You sure no survivors
ever turned up, murph?

243
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,793
Sure as we're walking
on the graza, dodge.

244
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,377
This way.

245
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,811
Let's go.

246
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,776
Jesus, she's no Fiddler's green.

247
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,156
You're wrong,
munder. She's beautiful.

248
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,155
Whoever was on here
originally sure left in a hurry.

249
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,711
Murphy, come in.

250
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,752
Whoa.

251
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,309
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard.

252
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,350
I'm Julie. I'll be your
hostess this evening.

253
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,349
J the love boat /

254
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,271
shh! Have some respect, okay?

255
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,282
Shh!

256
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,156
Hey, check out all
those champagne bottles.

257
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,043
It looks like we
missed one hell of a party.

258
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,537
- And one hell of a hangover.
- Shut up!

259
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:04,738
Shut up!

260
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,155
Let's go find the bridge.

261
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,699
- Such a manly man.
- What?

262
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,664
- What? All right?
- Shut up!

263
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,246
Come on, Mary, let's go.

264
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,836
Murph, how many
passengers did she carry?

265
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,303
= over 600.

266
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,639
The creme de la creme of
society from all over Europe.

267
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,725
Crew of 500 from Italy.

268
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,559
Talk to me, man.

269
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,724
How's everything going up there?

270
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,060
Okay, good.

271
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,313
This companionway should
get us to the bridge.

272
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,320
Here, epps, hold this.

273
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,670
What's going on?

274
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,640
- After you.
- No, after you.

275
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,680
No, no, no, no, no. After me.

276
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,973
Oh. Tough guy.

277
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,199
Don't let go!

278
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,036
= pull! Hold on!

279
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,044
Pull up!

280
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,748
Please, epps, don't let go!

281
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,375
Give me your hand. = pull us up!

282
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,592
= pull us back!

283
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,227
Oh, god!

284
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,520
I told you to
watch your fucking step!

285
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,522
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on,

286
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,111
you let me lead. Okay?

287
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,446
Okay - let's go.

288
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,151
I think I just shit my pants.

289
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,118
No, you always smell that way.

290
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,879
Compass is dead.

291
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,755
Helm's not responding, either.

292
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,378
Fuel tanks are empty.

293
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,553
She must've rode on full
throttle till she was bone-dry.

294
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,689
Epps!

295
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,941
Epps!

296
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,148
I'm looking for the ship's log.

297
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,944
Let's get this documentation back...

298
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,532
Are you okay? = yeah.

299
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,569
- You sure?
- Yeah.

300
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,957
Let's get to it.

301
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,212
Hey, check this out.

302
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,172
Hey, it's a watch.
Congratulations, buddy.

303
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,012
No. Look again, you moron.

304
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,597
It's a digital watch. Do the math.

305
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,638
They didn't have digital watches in 1962.

306
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,273
But she's ours now.

307
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,685
Let's get a couple hours of sleep.

308
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,854
We'll have to tow her at dawn.

309
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,898
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

310
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,447
Amen to that.

311
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,121
Oh, god.

312
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,585
Epps, can I get some tea?

313
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,171
Any sign of what might've happened?

314
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,178
How she got here?

315
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,257
That's the $64 million
question, isn't it?

316
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,633
You ever hear of a ship
called the Marie Celeste?

317
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,475
No.

318
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,889
She was a twin-masted brigantine

319
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,310
out of Charleston, south
Carolina, during the civil war.

320
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,855
She was bound for London with
a cargo of cotton in her hull.

321
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,862
Thanks.

322
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,780
Anyway, two months after she set sail,

323
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,991
she was sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

324
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,828
She was doing 12 knots an
hour in a stiff breeze.

325
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,991
Something wasn't quite right.

326
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,618
They didn't know what,
so they went on board.

327
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,003
You know what they found?

328
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,927
No passengers, no crew,

329
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,007
no captain, no sign of distress.

330
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,432
59 days after the last entry in the log,

331
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:27,273
that ship had traveled 4,500
miles across the open ocean,

332
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:31,394
past the rock of Gibraltar
and into the mediterranean sea

333
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,645
at full sail,

334
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,607
and nobody at the helm.

335
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,739
What do you make of that?

336
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,747
A ghost ship.

337
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,663
Hey, you smell that?

338
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,158
Ti smell bullshit.

339
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,046
Been on the sea a lot
longer than you, dodge.

340
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,211
T know.

341
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,381
I've seen things that
you can't even imagine.

342
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,600
Maritime history is
full of Marie celestes.

343
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,470
So, what's our plan?

344
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,563
Well, I think we should
do what we came to do.

345
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,602
Tie her up, tug her in.

346
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,565
What, you think our little tug

347
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,026
is gonna pull this entire ocean liner?

348
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,030
Yeah.

349
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,402
Not with the problems we got.

350
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,990
We could set her at anchor,

351
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,360
come back later with two or three tugs.

352
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,238
No, some Russian trawler
will come along, scoop her up.

353
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,160
I've already looked
for her anchors, anyway.

354
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,168
They're gone.

355
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,876
What do you think, greer?

356
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,212
If Santos gets the
engines working right,

357
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,207
it could take us two weeks minimum

358
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,924
to tow a vessel this size.

359
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,044
But for my share of what she's worth,

360
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,967
I'd drag her big ass
back to Anchorage myself.

361
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,650
Don't let go!

362
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,399
Help me! Don't let go!

363
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,655
Thought you might want a jacket.

364
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,789
Thanks.

365
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,630
Boy, do I miss that.

366
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,843
You okay?

367
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,553
You seem quiet since you came back.

368
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,348
I think I saw something I
couldn't possibly have seen.

369
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,104
Like what?

370
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,439
No, it's crazy. It doesn't matter.

371
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,773
No, I'm curious. Tell me.

372
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,407
I think I saw a little girl.

373
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,954
On, on the boat?

374
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,829
Yeah. Looking right at me.

375
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,837
And then what happened?

376
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,173
Nothing. She disappeared.

377
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,836
Sometimes, when I'd be
flying for hours on end,

378
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,131
I'd think I'd see stuff too.

379
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,976
It'd be there one second
and gone the next,

380
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,060
like a dream, you know?

381
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,194
Thanks.

382
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,401
- See you in the A.M.
- Okay.

383
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,408
Good night.

384
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,156
See you tomorrow. - Yeah.

385
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,053
She's got a big hole.

386
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,065
She's sinking.

387
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,017
This is where the damage is. See?

388
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,236
There's a breach in
the hull, about 10 by 20,

389
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,572
torn to the port collision bulkhead.

390
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,111
Did it hit an iceberg or something?

391
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,740
No, you don't need
an iceberg to rupture a hull.

392
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,907
I don't know, I was just...

393
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,906
Looks like she's been hit recently.

394
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,953
About a week ago, I'd say.

395
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,792
This is where we are.

396
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,708
The problem is this group of
islands 60 miles westerly,

397
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,546
nothing spectacular,
just a bunch of rocks,

398
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,006
a couple of thousand seals.

399
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,046
The antonia graza's caught here

400
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,420
in this really strong current loop.

401
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,514
And slowly but surly, she's
been pushed towards those rocks.

402
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:30,928
Last time she hit them.

403
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,221
What about next time”?

404
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,719
There won't be a next time.

405
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,096
We've got three days to fix it.

406
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,814
That's if the weather holds.

407
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,524
Why can't we tow it like it is?

408
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,689
It'd be like towing a '57 Cadillac

409
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,107
with four flat tires, man.

410
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,730
It's a bump in the road.

411
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,651
We can fix it.

412
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,365
Whoa, murph, bump in the road?

413
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,408
Look, you know, the breach
we can probably patch

414
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,407
if we can get to the inside.

415
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,329
Then we'll weld shut the
flooded compartments,

416
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,201
pump out the water through
the collision bulkhead,

417
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,249
run it right up to the aft peak.

418
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,044
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

419
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,758
We Jerry-rig it, set a
38-degree current drift

420
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,127
to clear the island chain.

421
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,510
What does all that mean?

422
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,385
Well, I mean, that's
a lot of work for three days.

423
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,182
Yeah, but with the
gear we've got on board,

424
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,147
and with what's on that
ship, we can give it a shot.

425
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,357
We can do it, right?

426
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,977
Murph, with the gear we've got on board,

427
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,354
I can't fix our little engine problem.

428
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,400
Why don't you quit bitching

429
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,820
and just overhaul the
starboard engine, please?

430
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,158
So that's the plan? Right.

431
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,162
= just do it.

432
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,290
= I'll call it in.

433
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,751
Eh, I wouldn't do that
if I were you, greer.

434
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:40,585
Maritime law states that...

435
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,375
Yeah, I know what maritime law states.

436
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,794
We just don't want any unexpected guests.

437
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,178
Just leave it.

438
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,299
Your call, captain.

439
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,219
All right, you know the drill.

440
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,812
We do a complete recon,
just enough to make sure

441
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,148
we've got no more problems
before we get to work.

442
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,392
Stay right beside me, greer.

443
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,768
No wandering off, okay?
All right.

444
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,738
Dodge, munder, go to the
port collision bulkhead.

445
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,027
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.

446
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,525
And call me if you need anything.

447
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,536
How about a pizza?

448
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,115
You're so funny.

449
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,786
"The only plan in this business
is that there is no plan.”

450
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,204
I mean, what is that?

451
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,702
I mean, what these
people talking crazy for?

452
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,453
Why are looking at me like that?

453
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,875
That's not even good english.

454
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,499
It's okay.

455
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,297
Hey, you hang in there, okay, preciosa?

456
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,135
Because someday he's gonna
find some other genius

457
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,720
to fix his goddamn boat.

458
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,727
Hey, you want to play like that? Yeah?

459
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,849
That is still sweet though, huh?

460
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,100
Light coming up.

461
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,567
Oh yeah.

462
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,070
You were right. She is beautiful.

463
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,197
She sure is.

464
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,739
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

465
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,839
Epps?

466
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,105
Yeah, all right, capitano.

467
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:03,413
Oh, shit.

468
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,787
J I'm just slippin" in the darkness j

469
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,239
Oh, shit.

470
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,949
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

471
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,737
Epps, the engine room is totally flooded.

472
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,248
Epps, can you hear me?

473
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,594
Wait!

474
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,963
What happened? You okay?

475
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,260
Come here.

476
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,054
What are you doing down there?

477
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,848
Did you hurt yourself?

478
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,603
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

479
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,149
Looks like someone used
it for target practice.

480
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,189
That's the happy version.

481
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,653
What's the not-so-happy version?

482
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,067
There were people in there.

483
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,733
I saw that little girl again.

484
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,745
What? Where?

485
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,324
I must be losing my goddamn mind.

486
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,200
Well, did she say anything?

487
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,544
Forget it. Come on.

488
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,570
Murphy, come in.

489
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,784
Dodge! Anybody!

490
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,457
Shit.

491
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,165
I think she's fucking with us.

492
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,168
Looks like central laundry.

493
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,843
This ventilation shaft
connects to the forward hold.

494
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,341
We need to see if it's flooded.

495
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,931
I might need help shutting it again.

496
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,019
So get ready.

497
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,023
Yoouu sure?

498
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,616
Murphy, where the hell are you?

499
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,334
How long do you think they've been here?

500
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,078
I don't know, a month, maybe less.

501
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,330
Well, what are we gonna do?

502
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,457
We're gonna call the coast
guard, get off this boat!

503
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,298
But the ship...

504
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,291
If it sinks, it sinks, Jack!

505
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,167
Come on.

506
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,179
You're right.

507
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,765
Stinks.

508
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,470
What the hell?

509
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,308
We came through here.

510
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,312
= no shit!

511
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,610
Come on!

512
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,446
This way. Come on, Jack.

513
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,302
What the...

514
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,101
When did you start wearing lipstick, epps?

515
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,439
Epps?

516
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,774
"Francesca." nice titties.

517
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,482
Not that you can hold a candle

518
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,575
to the future Mrs. greer, though.

519
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,045
Come on, Jack.

520
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,088
Stop dragging ass!

521
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,210
What's your problem?

522
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,851
What's this?

523
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,719
Forget it.

524
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,517
Let's go! Jack!

525
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,814
Hey!

526
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,558
This is '58 Jaguar x150.

527
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,185
I had dreams about this
car since I was a kid...

528
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,028
We have to get out of here now.

529
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,363
Do you understand me? Now.

530
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,576
Okay.

531
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,573
There's something moving in there.

532
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,184
Fuck!

533
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,395
Oh, oh my god! I hate rats!

534
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:28,777
What?

535
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,778
Oh, my god! Look at this!

536
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,523
I have to get Murphy.

537
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,116
Murphy!

538
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Murphy!

539
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,999
Is someone trying to call me?

540
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,665
Dodge? Munder?

541
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,790
Maureen, Maureen...

542
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,801
Who is Maureen?

543
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,801
It's my first name.

544
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,014
It's cold, it's cold...

545
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,054
Did he say "cold?"

546
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,096
The galley.

547
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,863
- It's cold.
- Please help us.

548
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,237
Don't go in there.

549
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,450
You fucking assholes!

550
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,457
Fuck you!

551
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,540
Take it easy!

552
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,250
Come on. You were fucking with us.

553
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,369
We fucked with you.

554
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,711
Why aren't you laughing?

555
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,046
Do you wanna hear something funnier?

556
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,417
We found a bunch of dead guys
floating in the laundry room.

557
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,135
And this in the cargo hold.

558
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,603
Need some help there, skipper?

559
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,409
I'm sorry.

560
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,339
- Holy shit!
- Oh, man.

561
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,102
Yes!

562
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:08,812
Yeah!

563
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,264
We're rich!

564
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,359
You son of a bitch! = rich!

565
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,397
Come on. Let's go.

566
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,651
= let's move this shit out of here!

567
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,277
You fucking creep!

568
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,546
How much we figure it's worth, boss?

569
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,841
There's a lot of gold there.

570
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,262
Hard to know.

571
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,386
2, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

572
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,809
- Jesus.
- I don't know, Murphy.

573
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,023
Lock boxes with half of fort Knox in them?

574
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,267
They gotta be insured.

575
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,893
I mean, there's no way
somebody's gonna let

576
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,566
this amount of gold just float away.

577
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,529
Well, this has got something to with it.

578
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,740
The markings have been filed down.

579
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:05,950
What does that mean?

580
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,820
Well, it means that somebody
didn't want this traceable.

581
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,201
It's stolen.

582
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,291
It might have something
to do with the reason why

583
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:16,001
this ship disappeared when it did.

584
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:16,915
= wait a minute.

585
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,539
If the gold's got
something to do with 1962,

586
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,586
then what about those
guys that epps found?

587
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:24,336
I mean, they can't be
more than three weeks old.

588
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,804
Look, somebody's gotta say
it, and it might as well be me.

589
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,298
This ship is fucked up, Murphy.

590
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,800
Earlier when I was doing my recon,

591
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,392
I could swear I heard a
woman's voice singing to me.

592
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,636
It was like she was,

593
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,764
like she was coming on to me or something.

594
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,734
Oh, no!

595
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,529
It was the sexiest
voice I ever heard, man.

596
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,066
Hey man, she got any backup singers?

597
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,449
But, brother, whatever
you're on, give me some!

598
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,905
I think maybe you're not quite ready

599
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,000
to get married, greer.

600
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,709
- Fuck you.
- Okay, guys.

601
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,249
What about the coast guard?

602
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,919
No, if you call the coast guard, I mean,

603
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,087
what if the gold did
turn out to be stolen?

604
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:09,513
Okay, under international maritime law,

605
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,758
anything that's found
in international waters

606
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,885
belongs to the finder.

607
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,807
Okay? That is the law.

608
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,976
- Right.
- Finders keepers.

609
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:21,818
Hey, look, if we're gonna
do this, I say we do it now.

610
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,278
I say we get our boat
going, grab the gold,

611
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,442
and get the hell out of here.

612
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,656
Okay, we leave the boat, take the gold.

613
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Who's with me?

614
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,035
I'm with the gold, man.

615
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,457
Gold.

616
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,793
The gold.

617
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,588
Epps?

618
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,502
I just want to get off this boat.

619
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,670
Okay. Let's go to work.

620
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,006
Okay. Warrior
is in position, murph.

621
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,099
Now, can we please get
the hell out of here?

622
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,266
Yeah, preciosa! Smell that money!

623
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,015
100 million, do you hear what I'm saying?

624
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,026
100 million!

625
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,145
Greer? Get those engines going.

626
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,943
I'm bringing the gold down.

627
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,190
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

628
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,653
Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, vato.

629
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,995
We almost got the gold on deck.

630
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,159
Andele! Andele!

631
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,374
I wanna see these gauges rocking,

632
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,084
because you just had a
overhaul from Santos, baby.

633
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,044
And you, I want you to give me some too.

634
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,628
Let's do this!

635
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,380
Hey, yo, greer! Fire it up!

636
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,341
We're gonna haul some ass out of here.

637
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,433
Bring it on!

638
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,974
We're gonna be so fucking rich!

639
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,105
Stop!

640
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,522
Stop! You don't know what you're doing!

641
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,316
Yeah, we're good to go, skipper.

642
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,487
Don't start the boat! He'll...

643
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:55,914
= shit!

644
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,822
Greer!

645
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,327
Greer! What the hell just happened?

646
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,963
= Jesus Christ!

647
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,749
Fire on deck!

648
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,885
Santos! Greer! Munder!

649
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,998
I got you.

650
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,370
Epps! I got munder!

651
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,378
Greer!

652
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,294
Greer! Come on!

653
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,750
Santos! Santos, answer me!

654
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,931
Santos!

655
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,446
I don't know what happened.

656
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,694
The engine room just blew.

657
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,496
I don't know, maybe
Santos rushed the engines,

658
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,616
didn't seal up the gaskets
right, I don't know.

659
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,913
Hey, Jack, did you find anything out

660
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,663
about this ship before
you sent us out here?

661
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,914
No, but I...

662
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,507
Look, I mean, we've got the
gold, and we are still alive.

663
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,297
Yeah, tell that to Santos, asshole!

664
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,795
Hey! Dodge, ease up!

665
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,046
Well, this is bullshit!

666
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,969
Hey, look, Santos came
here out of free will,

667
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,059
just like the rest of us.
What does that mean, huh?

668
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,677
What the fuck do you mean...
Hey! Enough!

669
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,680
Santos is dead because of you!

670
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,601
Come on, come on, come on.

671
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,225
That's not gonna bring him back.

672
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,416
Hey.

673
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,078
Murph, it's not your fault.

674
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,169
You know that.

675
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,385
Murph...

676
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,354
How is he?

677
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,480
All right, here's the plan.

678
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,815
The way I figure it,

679
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,355
we're professional salvors
with a fortune on board.

680
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,651
I say we do what we do best,
we fix this rust bucket.

681
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,400
Try and control her drift,
and clear those islands.

682
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,742
We can survive on here long
enough to get picked up.

683
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,111
Why is this even a question?

684
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,237
We have the materials.

685
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,364
We have the manpower.

686
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,661
Why don't we build a raft
and get off of this thing?

687
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,079
I told you guys earlier

688
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,203
that there was something
seriously wrong with this boat!

689
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,329
The longer we stay here,

690
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,580
the less chance we have of surviving.

691
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,298
You want to build a raft?
= I want to build a raft.

692
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,633
Epps, even with the warrior,

693
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,003
we were stretching to get
this done in three days.

694
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,629
We can't do this. I can't do it.

695
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,927
Munder, you're the
best spot-welder I know.

696
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:06,143
Come on. We can do it
right now, but I need you.

697
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,314
Okay, fine, whatever.

698
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,103
But, there's no way we're doing

699
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,227
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

700
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,729
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

701
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,482
Okay, fine. We'll chill
tonight and go in the A.M..

702
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,284
Greer? What do you say?

703
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,908
What, now you want to know
what the first mate has to say?

704
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,165
Well, I say go to hell, epps.

705
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,584
You're not fucking qualified
to get us off this ship.

706
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,548
And had Murphy let me do
it my way from the start,

707
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,292
we wouldn't be in this
situation right now.

708
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,635
And the coast guard, everybody's
so fucking worried about...

709
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,550
Right. So it's everybody
else's fault but your own, right?

710
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,844
We'd be on our way home, millionaires.

711
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,221
= that's bullshit.

712
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,933
Grow up, asshole.

713
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,481
- Hey!
- Fucking bitch!

714
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,349
Keep fucking talking!

715
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,694
Say another word!

716
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,278
Here it is.

717
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,451
Katie, b-deck.

718
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,752
You were alone.

719
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,544
100-to-1, somebody
poisoned the passengers

720
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,711
to get the gold.

721
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,834
Okay, okay, Sherlock,

722
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,255
if the passengers were poisoned,

723
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,844
why do you think these cans safe?

724
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,463
They're still sealed.

725
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,806
This stuff's been sealed for 40 years.

726
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,266
It's gotta be safe.

727
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,601
Okay, shoot
for it. Loser goes first.

728
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,728
Ah! Paper beats rock.

729
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,724
Best of three.

730
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,647
= bullshit! You lost.

731
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:20,815
Where's your empathy?

732
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,314
Winners do not empathize with losers.

733
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,615
Bon appetit.

734
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,586
I screwed up.

735
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,796
I should've called it in.

736
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,415
Damn! I knew better!

737
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,010
I'll make it home to you, baby. I swear.

738
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,349
What the hell are you looking at?

739
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,524
Mm, that's all right.

740
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,398
- No way.
- No, really, it's good.

741
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,240
Look, I'm not kidding.

742
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,862
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!

743
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,367
Mm. Oh, wow!

744
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,331
You gotta try that!

745
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,165
That's good!

746
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,582
That's great!

747
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,589
Katie?

748
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,264
Katie?

749
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,609
Can I tell you something else?

750
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,953
We get back, I'm gonna take my money

751
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,743
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

752
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,584
I'm gonna get you a lifetime supply

753
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,170
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

754
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,710
I already beat you to it, bro!

755
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,839
There's something on your...

756
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,078
Katie?

757
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,942
Buonasera, capitano. Benvenuto.

758
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,628
Vuoi ballare con me?

759
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,639
Who, me?

760
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,349
Si.

761
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,931
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

762
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,729
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

763
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,864
Can't cheat on your fiance
with a dead girl, right?

764
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,521
Her parents.

765
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,521
Please.

766
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,903
Don't close it.

767
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,408
I haven't seen them for years.

768
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,363
They moved to New York.

769
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,408
I was on my way to join them.

770
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:53,923
But they're dead now.

771
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,583
How would you know that?

772
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,506
When you're like this,
vou know these things.

773
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:07,518
My mother, she made me this dress.

774
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:10,481
Do you like it?

775
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,478
You remind me of her.

776
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
T don't think so.

777
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,996
Well, here.

778
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,155
You should have this back.

779
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:39,880
Oh, god, you really are a fucking ghost.

780
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,009
Where are you going?

781
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,233
Santos. Povero Santos.

782
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,571
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

783
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,207
= the Lorelei.

784
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,251
= she was adrift. We rescued her.

785
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,083
I've heard the story of the Lorelei.

786
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,971
I didn't know the graza was involved.

787
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,102
The gold was on board the Lorelei?

788
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,189
It says here "may 19, 1962."

789
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,108
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

790
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,868
There were no survivors
on board the Lorelei.

791
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:58,923
Jesus Christ!

792
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,304
Where you going?

793
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,200
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

794
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,736
So why aren't you with yours?

795
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,161
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?

796
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,129
My shipmates and 1.

797
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,383
Even the ones who aren't marked.

798
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,470
Marked? Katie, what do you mean?

799
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,010
When the boat's full...

800
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,894
What? It's okay, you can tell me.

801
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,934
When he has all the souls he needs,

802
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:01,642
and has filled his quota,

803
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,356
we'll all be ferried to...

804
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,025
What is it? What's wrong?

805
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,745
What is it? Katie, what's wrong?

806
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,990
He doesn't want me talking to you.

807
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:17,832
He who?

808
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,792
= but I'm not like the others!

809
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,536
Katie, you need to tell me.

810
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,379
You must go at once.

811
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,125
Leave the ship while you still can!

812
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,970
Katie, what is it?

813
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,008
Katie! Katie?

814
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,894
Epps?

815
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,147
Come on!

816
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,514
We have to leave.

817
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,606
- Where you going, Murphy?
- What?

818
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,030
What's the matter, huh?

819
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,035
It's me,

820
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,287
Santos.

821
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,662
You know, it's no fun lying around

822
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,621
down at the bottom of the ocean.

823
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,711
No bright lights at the end of the tunnel.

824
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,715
Not for me, murph.

825
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,500
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates. No.

826
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:16,137
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

827
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,509
So you know what?

828
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,227
You're coming along for the ride.

829
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,212
No!

830
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:50,299
Benvenuto a bordo.

831
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,014
Murphy?

832
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:00,813
Murph?

833
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:03,982
Murphy?

834
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,308
You all right, murph?

835
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,823
You okay?

836
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,947
What's the matter, murph? Come on.

837
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:17,955
= it's Mel

838
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:22,626
murph!

839
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,744
It's Mel

840
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,585
do it, come on.

841
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,669
It'll make you feel good.

842
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,266
= come on!

843
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,639
= come on!

844
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,856
Hey!

845
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,027
Murph!

846
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,866
Oh, god. Epps, are you okay?

847
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,952
He'll be safe if we
keep him in the aquarium.

848
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,824
No, listen to me. He was drunk.

849
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,701
He didn't know what he was doing.

850
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,455
Look, he just tried to kill you.

851
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,467
He stays in there.

852
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,511
Let's go find greer.

853
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,150
Any sign of him?

854
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,942
No, we looked all over.

855
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,731
The man is severely pissed off.

856
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,071
Seems to happen to everybody on this boat.

857
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,314
At least we weren't around 40 years ago.

858
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,442
Do you think somebody
poisoned the passengers

859
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,283
to get to the gold?

860
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,276
I know you think that's a little...

861
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,573
Extreme? Yeah, maybe.

862
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,071
But if the shoe fits...

863
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:43,992
I mean, look, next thing you know,

864
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,207
we'll be trying to kill each other.

865
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,951
What's with the heart?

866
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,578
Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

867
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,590
What girl?

868
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,835
She told me to get off this boat.

869
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,754
You mean she's talking to you now?

870
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,969
What the hell are
you guys talking about?

871
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,508
You're seeing ghosts, epps?

872
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,380
Anyway, just forget it.

873
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,303
So the ship's got a few kinks in it.

874
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,677
Look, I just say we
stick with munder's specs

875
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,849
and we try to fix the ship.

876
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,314
Well, there's like no way
five people and the gold

877
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,524
are gonna fit on any raft.

878
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,268
Murphy's not going anywhere right now,

879
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,894
and we're not leaving him here.

880
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,488
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.

881
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,323
Let's get going, guys. Come on.

882
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,708
That's the
collision bulkhead hatch.

883
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,421
Wheel's busted.
It's not gonna open.

884
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,040
Arming the c4.

885
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,132
Dodge? - I'm good.

886
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,922
- Munder?
- I'm good.

887
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,930
Contact.

888
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,722
There's the tear, portside.

889
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,219
Looks bigger from here.

890
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,104
I'll shut her up, no problem.

891
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,735
Munder, rudder's fixed.

892
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,195
You all right? - I'm good.

893
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,408
What do you think, dodge?

894
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,492
She'll hold.

895
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,407
Okay, we're set
with the pumps down here.

896
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,419
Start 'em up.

897
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:12,581
Copy that, epps.

898
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,796
One and two, kicking in.

899
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,131
I give it 12
hours till she's bone-dry.

900
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,545
Both on full.

901
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,544
Get ready, epps. Here it comes.

902
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,425
Great work, guys.

903
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,774
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.

904
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,163
If we control her drift as much
as possible with the rudder,

905
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,873
keeping her headed in this direction,

906
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,084
we should just clear those islands.

907
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,202
We'll keep this sucker afloat

908
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,329
as long as it takes to get picked up.

909
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,799
Son of a bitch, we may
just get out of this yet.

910
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,632
Kazillionaires.

911
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,969
I want you to check on the
bridge when you're done here.

912
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:03,802
Watch our drift.

913
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,639
I'm gonna see if I can
find greer down below.

914
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,397
Greer?

915
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,026
Greer?

916
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,832
Katie?

917
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,090
Greer? Jesus!

918
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,763
Aw shit!

919
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,685
Number two's clogged. Who's going?

920
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:57,693
You go.

921
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,278
Aw shit! Every single time!

922
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:06,862
Oh, my god.

923
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:09,496
Come with me.

924
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,286
I want to show you something.

925
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,505
No!

926
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,380
J silent in my sanity j

927
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,670
j I live safe inside my cell j

928
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,714
j in the darkness that surrounds me j

929
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,212
j I see my own special hell

930
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,260
j comfort in my suffering j

931
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,680
j; Feeling warm inside this pain j

932
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,303
j; Four walls coming down on me j

933
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:43,351
j come on down again

934
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:52,654
j you woke me out of my secret grave j

935
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,151
j you let your pretty world in j

936
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,908

j to be this way j

938
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:05,161
j but you took me out of my skin j

939
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,753
j unholy walls j you woke it j

940
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:10,750

J now you're in my world j

945
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,742
j; Did you dream it'd be so small j

946
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,907
j my little box was perfect j

947
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,372
j until you destroyed it all j

01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,673
j is all that's left to taste j

952
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,008

j cradle falls j

960
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,457
Murphy.

961
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,502
Murphy!

962
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:39,849
Come on! No!

963
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,644
Come on!

964
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,143
Come on.

965
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,762
You can't die on me!

966
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,408
Dodge, Murphy's dead.

967
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,496
- What?
- We have got to get off

968
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,740
this boat now.

969
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:48,582
You, me, and munder,

970
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,793
there is a reason you why the
three of us are still alive.

971
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,162
That's why he came after
us, to fix his ship.

972
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:54,254
I just saw Murphy.

973
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:56,426
What's happening?

974
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,346
T don't know.

975
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,591
But I want you and dodge
to stay on the rudder here.

976
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:06,638
Wait! But you just said...

977
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,510
Dodge, listen to me.

978
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,682
I'm gonna get munder.

979
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,646
We're gonna check and see
if the welds are holding.

980
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,561
I want you both to stay
here till we get back.

981
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,809
You understand?

982
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,311
I do not want you out
of each other's sight.

983
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,984
Take this.

984
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:19,991
Take it.

985
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,403
- Be careful down there.
- Ti will.

986
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,649
Munder! Munder!

987
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,009
That's it, then. We made it.

988
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,386
For now.

989
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,630
I'm gonna go check on epps.

990
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,256
No, you're not. She said to wait here.

991
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:28,303
Yeah, I know, but I just wanna make sure

992
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,891
she's okay.
Hey, she said to wait!

993
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:30,895
So wait.

994
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,785
You disgust me.

995
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,656
What did you say?
=- you heard me.

996
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,784
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.

997
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,953
She says "jump,” and you jump.

998
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,201
You're disgusting.

999
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,543
I don't have time for this.

1000
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,255
Who the hell are you?

1001
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,218
Don't worry about who I am.

1002
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,929
The question is, who are you?

1003
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,139
I've seen the way you look at her.

1004
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:09,973
You worship her,

1005
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,308
yet you've never had
the balls to tell her,

1006
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,725
because you're a weak, cowardly child.

1007
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,270
However, if you'll kindly
step out of my way,

1008
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,767
I'll make your dream a reality.

1009
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,356
You know, dodge, if you kill
somebody, you go to hell.

1010
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,536
Well, you live for her.

1011
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,619
You willing to die for her?

1012
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,288
Epps!

1013
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:16,834
I shot ferriman.

1014
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,285
He's dead.

1015
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,288
Yeah? Don't be so sure, dodge.

1016
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,584
What are you doing?

1017
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,129
Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

1018
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,751
It's taken its last victim.

1019
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,843
= but that'll kill us.

1020
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,462
We're gonna have to take our chances.

1021
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,884
What about the gold?

1022
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:32,972
You fucking kidding?

1023
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,343
We're not getting the gold off this boat.

1024
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,184
Nobody ever does.

1025
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,394
Wait, wait, wait!

1026
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:42,934
That gold can give us
everything we ever wanted.

1027
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,561
We could have our own boat, the two of us.

1028
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,026
We could have a life together, you and me.

1029
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,775
What are you talking about?

1030
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,823
Dodge, we gotta get out of here, now.

1031
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,702
Well, I can't let you do that.

1032
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,040
So that's it, huh?

1033
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,925
All right. Okay.

1034
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,468
You win. All right.

1035
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,926
All right! All right!

1036
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,598
Fucking bitch!

1037
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,646
All right, you win!

1038
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,139
Go ahead, do it!

1039
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,608
Go ahead. Blow it up!

1040
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,611
Kill us all!

1041
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:32,783
Hey, dodge, why haven't you
asked me where munder is?

1042
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:45,379
Well, I suppose that's
because I already know.

1043
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:49,292
You're not gonna pull
that trigger, Maureen.

1044
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,839
Try me.

1045
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,259
Dodge made the same mistake. He's dead.

1046
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,849
Katie told you, didn't she?

1047
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,765
You see, souls without
sin can't be marked.

1048
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,604
Makes them tough to control.

1049
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,690
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,

1050
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,024
we'll all go down together.

1051
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,064
What the fuck are you?

1052
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,779
I'm a salvager, just like you.

1053
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:14,825
You collect ships, I collect souls.

1054
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,537
And when I fill my quota,
ti send a boatload home.

1055
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,496
This will make management happy.

1056
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:22,287
You see, it's a job,

1057
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,376
given to me after a lifetime of sin.

1058
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,336
So if I lose this ship,
management won't be happy,

1059
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:30,628
which is not a good thing.

1060
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,043
I don't seem to be getting through to you.

1061
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,888
What I'm asking for is an exchange.

1062
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,348
This ship for your life.

1063
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,809
I want my crew back.

1064
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,305
Sorry. Once a passenger's
marked, they're mine.

1065
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:46,440
Then I guess it's over.

1066
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:00,116
All you had to do was fix the ship!

1067
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:05,956
I gave you a great opportunity.

1068
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,587
All you had to do was take it.

1069
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,427
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

1070
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,300
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.

1071
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,371
No!

1072
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:21,461
J; Always, known in, all my time j

1073
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:23,800
I a little left of center now j

1074
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:27,296
I reflect as I realize j

1075
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:31,425
j that all I need is to find
the middle pillar path

1076
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:35,224
j to sit like the sun by a
star in the sky and just be j

1077
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:39,521
