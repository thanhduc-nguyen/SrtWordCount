1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,707
October is inventory time,

2
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,416
so right now, Statler Toyota

3
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,374
is making the best deals of the year

4
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,624
on all 1985-model Toyotas.

5
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,249
You won't find a better car

6
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:41,624
at a better price with better
service anywhere in Hill Valley.

7
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,999
That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.

8
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,957
The Senate is
expected to vote on this today.

9
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:55,208
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility

10
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:57,957
have denied the rumor that
a case of missing plutonium

11
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:01,291
was in fact stolen from
their vault two weeks ago.

12
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,832
A Libyan terrorist group
had claimed responsibility

13
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,124
for the alleged theft.

14
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,291
However, officials now attribute

15
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,790
the discrepancy to a
simple clerical error.

16
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:14,041
The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.

17
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,082
Hey, Doc?

18
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,791
Doc?

19
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,708
Hello! Anybody home?

20
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,042
Einstein, come here, boy.

21
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,708
What's going on? Oh, God.

22
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,499
Oh, Jesus!

23
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,374
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?

24
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,542
Whoa!

25
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:40,917
Rock 'n' roll.

26
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,667
Yo. DOC: Marty, is that you?

27
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:52,792
Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you?

28
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,042
Thank God I've found you.

29
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,542
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

30
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,375
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

31
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,667
Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

32
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:00,751
Yeah.

33
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,500
Doc, what's going on?

34
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:04,542
Where you been all week? Working.

35
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,000
Where's Einstein? Is he with you?

36
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,792
Yeah, he's right here.

37
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:10,500
You know, Doc, you left
your equipment on all week.

38
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:13,167
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

39
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,709
You better not hook up to the amplifier.

40
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,083
There's a slight
possibility of overload.

41
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:19,542
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

42
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:22,042
Good. I'll see you
tonight. Don't forget now.

43
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,918
1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

44
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,042
Right.

45
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,542
Are those my clocks I hear?

46
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,292
Yeah, it's 8:00.

47
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,876
Perfect! My experiment worked!

48
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,459
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

49
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,459
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

50
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,209
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

51
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:48,417
Precisely.

52
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,876
Damn! I'm late for school.

53
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,626
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.

54
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,709
Strickland's looking for you.

55
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,126
If you get caught, it'll
be four tardies in a row.

56
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,418
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

57
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,627
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.

58
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,043
The doc set all his
clocks 25 minutes slow.

59
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,376
Doc?

60
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,834
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

61
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,418
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

62
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,792
And one for you, McFly. I
believe that makes four in a row.

63
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:21,834
Let me give you a nickel's
worth of free advice, young man.

64
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,084
This so-called Dr. Brown is
dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

65
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:27,585
You hang around with him, you're
gonna end up in big trouble.

66
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:28,959
Ooh. Yes, sir.

67
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,251
You got a real attitude
problem, McFly. You're a slacker.

68
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:35,168
You remind me of your
father when he went here.

69
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,627
He was a slacker, too.

70
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,793
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

71
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,543
I noticed your band is on the roster

72
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,627
for the dance auditions
after school today.

73
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:46,126
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.

74
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,001
You're too much like your old man.

75
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,335
No McFly ever amounted to anything

76
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,126
in the history of Hill Valley.

77
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:56,251
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

78
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,835
Next, please.

79
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:06,793
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

80
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,418
All right.

81
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:13,960
We're the... We're the Pinheads.

82
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,085
One, two, three.

83
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,752
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

84
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:41,960
Hold it, fellas.

85
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,710
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

86
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,002
Next, please.

87
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,501
Bring up the next group, please.

88
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,376
Re-elect
Mayor "Goldie" Wilson.

89
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,460
Progress is his middle name.

90
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,627
"Too loud." I can't believe it.

91
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,336
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

92
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,793
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

93
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,294
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

94
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,336
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good,

95
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,211
and this audition
tape of yours is great.

96
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:14,336
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

97
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:16,211
It's like Doc's always
saying. Yeah, I know. I know.

98
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:17,336
"If you put your mind to it,

99
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,919
"you can accomplish anything."

100
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,002
That's good advice, Marty.

101
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,543
All right, okay, Jennifer.

102
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,585
What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

103
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,585
What if they say I'm no good?

104
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,960
What if they say, "Get out of
here, kid. You got no future"?

105
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:33,252
I mean, I just don't think I
can take that kind of rejection.

106
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,336
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

107
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,169
Come on. He's not that
bad. Save the clock tower.

108
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:40,793
At least he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

109
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,377
Check out that 4x4.

110
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,377
That is hot.

111
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,710
Okay. Back her up.

112
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,044
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

113
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:54,002
Wouldn't it be great to take
that truck up to the lake?

114
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:58,002
Throw a couple of
sleeping bags in the back.

115
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,294
Lie out underneath the stars.

116
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,211
Stop it. What?

117
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,669
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

118
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:07,960
No, get out of town.

119
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,794
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

120
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,461
Jennifer, my mother would freak out

121
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,877
if she knew I was
going up there with you,

122
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,127
and I'd get the standard lecture about

123
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:18,586
how she never did that kind
of stuff when she was a kid.

124
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,544
I mean, look, I think
the woman was born a nun.

125
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,127
She's just trying to
keep you respectable.

126
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,377
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

127
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:27,669
Terrible.

128
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:31,419
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

129
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:35,544
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an
initiative to replace that clock.

130
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,211
Thirty years ago, lightning
struck that clock tower

131
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,044
and the clock hasn't run since.

132
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:42,419
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society

133
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,920
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

134
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:46,753
as part of our history and heritage.

135
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:47,878
There you go, lady. There's a quarter.

136
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,003
Thank you.

137
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,127
Don't forget to take a flyer.

138
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:51,211
Right.

139
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,211
Save the clock tower!

140
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,461
Where were we?

141
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:58,045
Right about here.

142
00:10:58,128 --> 00:10:59,211
Jennifer!

143
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,669
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.

144
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:06,211
I'll call you tonight.

145
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:07,419
I'll be at my grandma's.

146
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,920
Here, let me give you the number.

147
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:15,961
Bye.

148
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,128
Bravo,
Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

149
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:05,295
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

150
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,295
Perfect. Just perfect.

151
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,920
I can't believe you'd loan me your car

152
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,836
without telling me it had a blind spot.

153
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,503
Blind spot? I could've been killed.

154
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,212
Now, Biff, now, I never noticed

155
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:29,295
that the car had any blind spot
before when I would drive it.

156
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,794
Hi, Son.

157
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,086
What, are you
blind, McFly? It's there.

158
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:35,045
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

159
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,128
Biff, can I assume

160
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:41,587
that your insurance is
going to pay for the damage?

161
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:43,961
My insurance? It's your car.

162
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,253
Your insurance should pay for it.

163
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:46,878
I wanna know who's
going to pay for this?

164
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,836
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

165
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:50,003
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

166
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,086
Ah...

167
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,128
And where's my reports?

168
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,712
Well, I haven't finished those up yet,

169
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:57,462
but I figured since
they weren't due till...

170
00:12:57,546 --> 00:13:00,462
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?

171
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,462
Think, McFly. Think! All right.

172
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,629
I got to have time to get them retyped.

173
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:06,961
Do you realize what would happen

174
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:09,837
if I hand in my reports
in your handwriting?

175
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,462
I'll get fired.

176
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:14,337
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

177
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,337
Would you? Of course not, Biff.

178
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,879
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

179
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:21,795
Now, look. I'll finish
those reports on up tonight,

180
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,712
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

181
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,629
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

182
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:27,962
McFly, your shoe's untied.

183
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,046
Oh.

184
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:31,503
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

185
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:33,462
Got the place fixed
up nice, though, McFly.

186
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,795
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

187
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,545
and all you got for me is lite beer?

188
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:49,962
What are you looking at, butthead?

189
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,004
Say hi to your mom for me.

190
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,795
I know what you're going to say, Son,

191
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,503
and you're right. You're right.

192
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:06,587
But Biff just happens
to be my supervisor,

193
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,296
And I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

194
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,171
But the car, Dad.

195
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,629
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

196
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:21,629
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

197
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,879
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

198
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,004
Do you have any clue?

199
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,754
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

200
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,754
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,421
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

202
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,421
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

203
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:38,754
and headaches of playing at that dance.

204
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,504
He's absolutely right, Marty.

205
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,087
The last thing you need is headaches.

206
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:54,546
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

207
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,504
Your Uncle Joey didn't
make parole again.

208
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,213
I think it would be nice if
you all dropped him a line.

209
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,046
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

210
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,588
He's your brother, Mom.

211
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,504
Yeah. I think it's a major
embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.

212
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,795
We all make mistakes in life, children.

213
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,588
God damn it. I'm late.

214
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,338
David, watch your mouth!

215
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:19,004
You come here and kiss your
mother before you go. Come here.

216
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:22,171
Come on, Mom. Make it
fast. I'll miss my bus.

217
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,129
See you later, Pop.

218
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,962
Time to change that oil.

219
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:33,630
Hey, Marty. I'm not
your answering service.

220
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:36,129
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

221
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,463
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

222
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:39,962
I don't like her, Marty.

223
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:43,171
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

224
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:46,129
Oh, Mother, there's nothing
wrong with calling a boy.

225
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:49,713
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

226
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,463
When I was your age, I never
chased a boy or called a boy

227
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:56,087
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

228
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,630
Then how am I supposed
to ever meet anybody?

229
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,755
Well, it'll just happen.

230
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,338
Like the way I met your father.

231
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,129
That was so stupid. Grandpa
hit him with the car.

232
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:10,379
It was meant to be.

233
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:14,755
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him,

234
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,504
then none of you would have been born.

235
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:17,880
Yeah, well.

236
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,213
I still don't understand
what Dad was doing

237
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:21,713
in the middle of the street.

238
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,254
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

239
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,463
What, Lorraine? What?

240
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:29,880
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car

241
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:31,671
and brought him into the house.

242
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:34,963
He seemed so helpless,

243
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:40,713
like a little lost puppy, and
my heart just went out to him.

244
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,963
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've
told us this story a million times.

245
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,379
You felt sorry for him,

246
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,922
so you decided to go with him

247
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,546
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

248
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:51,796
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

249
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:55,755
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

250
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,880
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

251
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:06,464
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

252
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,546
It was then that I realized

253
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,505
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

254
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:43,547
Hello.

255
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,088
Marty, you didn't
fall asleep, did you?

256
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:46,631
Doc.

257
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:50,088
No. No, don't be silly.

258
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:53,422
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

259
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,339
Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?

260
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:59,172
Yeah. I'm on my way.

261
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,547
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy? Huh?

262
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:21,756
Doc!

263
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,380
Marty! You made it!

264
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,505
Yeah.

265
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,672
Welcome to my latest
experiment. This is the big one,

266
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,631
the one I've been
waiting for all my life.

267
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:31,173
Well, it's a DeLorean...

268
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,089
Bear with me, Marty. All your
questions will be answered.

269
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:34,505
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

270
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,631
Doc,

271
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:36,714
is that a DEVO suit?

272
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,089
Never mind that now.

273
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:39,256
Not now.

274
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:40,381
All right. I'm ready.

275
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:42,714
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

276
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,964
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

277
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,631
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.,

278
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:50,964
and this is temporal
experiment number one.

279
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,089
Come on, Einie. Hey,
hey, boy, get in there.

280
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:55,465
That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

281
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:57,923
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

282
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,089
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

283
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:05,548
Okay.

284
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:09,506
Please note that Einstein's clock

285
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:12,506
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

286
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,173
Got it? Right. Check, Doc.

287
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:15,256
Good.

288
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,381
Have a good trip,
Einstein. Watch your head.

289
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,381
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

290
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:29,632
Watch this.

291
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:32,006
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

292
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:37,298
Jesus!

293
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,840
Not me! The car! The car!

294
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,465
If my calculations are correct,

295
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:06,632
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

296
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,131
you're going to see some serious shit.

297
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,798
Watch this. Watch this.

298
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,216
What did I tell you?

299
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,757
88 miles per hour!

300
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:15,341
The temporal displacement occurred

301
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:18,757
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

302
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,382
Jesus Christ!

303
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,882
Jesus Christ, Doc! You
disintegrated Einstein!

304
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:27,590
Calm down, Marty. I didn't
disintegrate anything.

305
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:32,382
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

306
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,840
Then where the hell are they?

307
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:35,424
The appropriate question is,

308
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:37,049
"When the hell are they?"

309
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:41,591
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

310
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:45,007
I sent him into the future.

311
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:48,132
One minute into the future, to be exact.

312
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:51,424
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds,

313
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:54,382
we shall catch up with
him and the time machine.

314
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,924
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

315
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:04,466
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

316
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,798
out of a DeLorean?

317
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:07,924
The way I see it,

318
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:09,882
if you're going to build
a time machine into a car,

319
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:11,798
why not do it with some style?

320
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:15,049
Besides, the stainless-steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

321
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,090
Look out!

322
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:04,050
What? Is it hot?

323
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,841
It's cold. Damn cold.

324
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,466
Einstein, you little devil!

325
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,758
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute

326
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:18,217
behind mine and still ticking!

327
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:22,925
He's all right. He's fine.

328
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,341
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

329
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,050
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

330
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,716
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

331
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,883
He skipped over that minute

332
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,841
to instantly arrive
at this moment in time.

333
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:35,758
Come here. I'll show you how it works.

334
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:36,966
All right.

335
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:41,382
First, you turn the time circuits on.

336
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:46,758
This readout tells
you where you're going.

337
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:48,050
This one tells you where you are.

338
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,633
This one tells you where you were.

339
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:52,050
You input your destination
time on this keypad.

340
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:53,383
Say you want to see the signing

341
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,008
of the Declaration of Independence.

342
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,091
Or witness the birth of Christ.

343
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,508
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

344
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:08,300
November 5th, 1955.

345
00:25:12,134 --> 00:25:16,383
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

346
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:18,966
What? I don't get it. What happened?

347
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:24,008
That was the day I invented time
travel. I remember it vividly.

348
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,674
I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.

349
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,883
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,

350
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:29,508
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

351
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,634
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

352
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:35,050
a vision, a picture in my
head, a picture of this.

353
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:40,467
This is what makes time travel
possible. The flux capacitor.

354
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,342
Flux capacitor?

355
00:25:42,426 --> 00:25:44,883
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

356
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,383
to realize the vision of that day.

357
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:49,717
My God, has it been that long?

358
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,217
Things have certainly
changed around here.

359
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,050
I remember when this was all farmland

360
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,258
as far as the eye could see.

361
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:01,966
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

362
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:06,800
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

363
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:14,383
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

364
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:17,383
Does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

365
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,050
Unfortunately, no. It requires something

366
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:21,258
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

367
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:23,592
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

368
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:26,050
Are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

369
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,133
Hey, hey, hey! Keep
rolling. Keep rolling there.

370
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,051
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

371
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:31,342
but I need a nuclear reaction

372
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,884
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

373
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:37,550
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

374
00:26:38,134 --> 00:26:39,800
Did you rip that off?

375
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,550
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

376
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:45,842
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

377
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,383
so I took their plutonium and, in
turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing

378
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:50,176
full of used pinball machine parts.

379
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:52,217
Come on. Let's get you
a radiation suit. Jesus!

380
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:53,675
We must prepare to reload.

381
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,259
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

382
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:29,301
Don't you lose those tapes now.

383
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:30,800
I need that as a record.

384
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,759
Let's put this back here. There we go.

385
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:37,884
I almost forgot my luggage.

386
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:40,717
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

387
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,092
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

388
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:43,800
The future?

389
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:45,592
That's where you're going?

390
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:47,218
That's right, 25 years into the future.

391
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:50,343
I've always dreamed of seeing the
future, looking beyond my years,

392
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:52,551
seeing the progress of mankind.

393
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:53,842
Why not?

394
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:57,717
I'll also be able to see who
wins the next 25 World Series.

395
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,218
Doc.

396
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,343
Huh?

397
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,926
Look me up when you get there.

398
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:06,176
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

399
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,967
I, Dr. Emmett Brown,

400
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,426
am about to embark on
an historic journey.

401
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:22,884
What am I thinking of?

402
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,468
I almost forgot to
bring extra plutonium.

403
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,092
How did I ever expect to get
back? One pellet, one trip.

404
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:29,801
I must be out of my mind.

405
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,426
What is it, Einie?

406
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,426
Oh, my God.

407
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,301
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

408
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:48,468
Run for it, Marty!

409
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,593
Who? Who?

410
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:52,468
Who do you think? The Libyans!

411
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:57,259
Holy shit!

412
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,134
I'll draw their fire!

413
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:12,134
Doc, wait!

414
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:27,801
No!

415
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:30,593
You bastard!

416
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:50,718
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

417
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,760
Go!

418
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:40,927
Come on! Move, damn it!

419
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:43,676
Jesus!

420
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:05,260
Holy shit!

421
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,719
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

422
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,844
What is it? What is it, Pa?

423
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:06,844
Looks like an airplane without wings.

424
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:10,220
That ain't no airplane. Look.

425
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:32,510
Children!

426
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:33,928
Listen... Whoa.

427
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:47,802
Hello?

428
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,303
Excuse me.

429
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,969
Sorry about your barn.

430
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,011
It's already mutated
into human form! Shoot it!

431
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,261
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

432
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,636
Get away!

433
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:15,969
Hold it.

434
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:17,928
Shoot it, Pa!

435
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:23,386
My pine! Why you...

436
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,844
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

437
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,178
All right. All right. Okay, McFly.

438
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,386
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

439
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:40,261
It's just a very intense dream.

440
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:24,720
Listen, you got to help me.

441
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:27,095
Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

442
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:30,136
It can't be.

443
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:37,553
This is nuts.

444
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,595
Come on.

445
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:45,887
Perfect.

446
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,721
Remember, fellow
citizens, the future is in your hands.

447
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:48,596
If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

448
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,721
Progress is his middle name.

449
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:53,387
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform

450
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:56,013
means more jobs, better education,

451
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:58,888
bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.

452
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:02,971
On election day, cast your
vote for a proven leader.

453
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,387
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

454
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,846
This has got to be a dream.

455
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,596
Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

456
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,679
What?

457
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:33,429
What's with the life preserver?

458
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:40,679
I just want to use the phone.

459
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:41,971
Yeah, it's in the back.

460
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:46,222
Brown.

461
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:50,013
Great. You're alive.

462
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:03,305
Come on.

463
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,596
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...

464
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,305
Are you going to order something, kid?

465
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,263
Yeah. Give me a Tab.

466
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,555
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

467
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,721
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

468
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,555
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

469
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,846
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

470
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:32,930
Something without sugar.

471
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:41,763
Hey, McFly.

472
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:46,472
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:47,846
Biff.

474
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:50,597
I'm talking to you,
McFly, you Irish bug!

475
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:52,846
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?

476
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,680
You got my homework finished, McFly?

477
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:58,013
Well, actually, I figured since
it wasn't due till Monday...

478
00:38:58,097 --> 00:38:59,888
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

479
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,347
Think, McFly. Think! Okay.

480
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,305
I got to have time to recopy it.

481
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:06,555
You realize what would happen

482
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,138
if I hand in my homework
in your handwriting?

483
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,930
I'll get kicked out of school.

484
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:13,472
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

485
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:16,388
Would you?

486
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:17,513
Now, of course not, Biff.

487
00:39:17,598 --> 00:39:19,513
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.

488
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:21,138
What are you looking at, butthead?

489
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:23,555
Biff, get a load of this
guy's life preserver.

490
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,347
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

491
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,722
How about my homework, McFly?

492
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:31,722
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

493
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:35,096
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

494
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:36,722
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.

495
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,096
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!

496
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,347
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.

497
00:39:41,431 --> 00:39:42,513
I don't want to see you in here again.

498
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:45,305
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

499
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:08,097
What?

500
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,472
You're George McFly.

501
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,388
Yeah. Who are you?

502
00:40:11,473 --> 00:40:13,097
Say! Why do you let those boys

503
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,680
push you around like that for?

504
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:16,056
Well, they're bigger than me.

505
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,764
Stand tall, boy. Have
some respect for yourself.

506
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:21,056
Don't you know, if you let
people walk over you now,

507
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,223
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

508
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:24,722
Look at me. You think I'm gonna

509
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,472
spend the rest of my
life in this slop house?

510
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:28,348
Watch it, Goldie. No, sir!

511
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:29,639
I'm gonna make something of myself.

512
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:30,931
I'm going to night school,

513
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:33,223
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

514
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,181
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

515
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:36,639
Yeah, I'm...

516
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:38,680
Mayor!

517
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:43,348
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

518
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:44,931
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

519
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:47,348
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.

520
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:49,722
I'll be the most powerful
man in Hill Valley,

521
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:51,597
and I'm going to clean up this town.

522
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:54,639
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

523
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:01,306
Mayor Goldie Wilson. I
like the sound of that.

524
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:17,223
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

525
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:50,514
He's a peeping Tom.

526
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:57,223
Dad!

527
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:12,056
Hey, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Who are you?

528
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,890
Stella! Another one of these damn kids

529
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:18,348
jumped in front of my car!

530
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,514
Come on out here! Help
me take him in the house!

531
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:30,015
Mom? That you?

532
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:34,098
There, there, now. Just relax.

533
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:39,765
You've been asleep for
almost nine hours now.

534
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,057
I had a horrible nightmare.

535
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:49,640
I dreamed that I went back
in time. It was terrible.

536
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:52,015
Well,

537
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:56,098
you're safe and sound
now, back in good old 1955.

538
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,598
1955?

539
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,182
You're my... You're my...

540
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:07,431
My name is Lorraine.

541
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:10,057
Lorraine Baines.

542
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:11,224
Yeah.

543
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,015
But you're... You're so...

544
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:18,598
You're so thin!

545
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:22,390
Just relax, Calvin. You got
a big bruise on your head.

546
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,515
Where are my pants?

547
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,681
Over there, on my hope chest.

548
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:36,182
I've never seen purple
underwear before, Calvin.

549
00:43:36,974 --> 00:43:39,765
Calvin? Why do you
keep calling me Calvin?

550
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:42,765
Well, that is your name,
isn't it? Calvin Klein?

551
00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:45,973
It's written all over your underwear.

552
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,765
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

553
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:52,806
No, actually, people call me Marty.

554
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:54,265
Oh.

555
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:57,307
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

556
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,599
Marty.

557
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,390
Klein.

558
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:11,057
Do you mind if I sit here?

559
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:12,349
No. Fine.

560
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:14,807
No. Good. Fine. Good.

561
00:44:16,808 --> 00:44:19,015
That's a big bruise you have there.

562
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:23,057
Lorraine, are you up there?

563
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:25,140
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

564
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:28,182
Quick! Put your pants back on!

565
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:39,224
So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

566
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:40,307
Excuse me?

567
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:41,390
I guessed you're a sailor.

568
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:43,641
That's why you wear that life preserver.

569
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,224
Coast Guard.

570
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,224
Sam, here's the young man

571
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:48,724
you hit with your car out there.

572
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:49,891
He's all right. Thank God.

573
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:52,182
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

574
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:54,182
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

575
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:55,849
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.

576
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:57,349
Come in here to dinner.

577
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,432
Now, let's see. You
already know Lorraine.

578
00:44:59,516 --> 00:45:03,349
This is Milton, this
is Sally, that's Toby,

579
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:06,641
and over there in the
playpen is little baby Joey.

580
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:10,307
So, you're my uncle Joey.

581
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:13,557
Better get used to these bars, kid.

582
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:17,766
Yes. Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

583
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:19,557
He cries whenever we take him out,

584
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:21,641
so we just leave him
in there all the time.

585
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:23,933
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

586
00:45:24,017 --> 00:45:26,225
Listen, I really ought to...

587
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:27,515
Sit here, Marty.

588
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,974
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing

589
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,515
and come in here and eat your dinner.

590
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:36,058
Look at it roll.

591
00:45:36,142 --> 00:45:38,183
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.

592
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:48,933
It's our first television set.

593
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:50,641
Dad just picked it up today.

594
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,599
Do you have a television?

595
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:56,557
Well, yeah. You know
we have two of them.

596
00:45:56,642 --> 00:45:59,433
Wow! You must be rich.

597
00:45:59,516 --> 00:46:01,058
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

598
00:46:01,142 --> 00:46:03,599
Nobody has two television sets.

599
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,933
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.

600
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:12,433
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

601
00:46:12,517 --> 00:46:15,807
This is where Ralph dresses
up as a man from space.

602
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:19,308
What do you mean, you've
seen this? It's brand-new.

603
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:21,724
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

604
00:46:22,476 --> 00:46:24,266
What's a rerun?

605
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:25,475
You'll find out.

606
00:46:25,975 --> 00:46:30,141
You know, Marty, you look so
familiar to me. Do I know your mother?

607
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,600
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

608
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:35,266
Oh, then I
want to give her a call.

609
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:37,016
I don't want her to worry about you.

610
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,475
You can't.

611
00:46:39,351 --> 00:46:42,642
That is, nobody's home.

612
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,016
Oh.

613
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:46,516
Yet.

614
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:48,141
Oh.

615
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:52,642
Listen, do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

616
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,225
It's on the other end of town.

617
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,850
A block past Maple. East end of town.

618
00:46:56,934 --> 00:46:58,308
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

619
00:46:58,392 --> 00:47:00,892
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

620
00:47:01,768 --> 00:47:03,767
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

621
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:05,141
Mother?

622
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:08,391
With Marty's parents out of town,

623
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:11,350
don't you think he
ought to spend the night?

624
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:13,850
I mean, after all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

625
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,016
That's true, Marty.

626
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,725
I think maybe you
should spend the night.

627
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:19,350
I think you're our responsibility.

628
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:21,058
Gee, I don't know.

629
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:22,892
And he can sleep in my room.

630
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,558
I gotta go! I gotta go!

631
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,059
Thanks very much. It was wonderful.

632
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:31,475
You were all great. See
you all later. Much later.

633
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,725
He's a very strange young man.

634
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:39,934
He's an idiot.

635
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:43,975
Comes from upbringing. His
parents are probably idiots, too.

636
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,558
Lorraine, you ever have a kid

637
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,934
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

638
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:27,059
Doc?

639
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:29,516
Don't say a word.

640
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:31,892
I don't wanna know your name.

641
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,142
I don't want to know anything about you.

642
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:34,975
Listen, Doc... Quiet!

643
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,558
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

644
00:48:36,643 --> 00:48:38,808
Doc, you got to help... Quiet. Quiet.

645
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,558
I'm going to read your thoughts.

646
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:47,226
Let's see now. You've come
here from a great distance?

647
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,434
Yeah. Exactly.

648
00:48:48,518 --> 00:48:49,642
Don't tell me!

649
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:51,725
You want me to buy a subscription

650
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:53,142
to the Saturday Evening Post.

651
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:54,267
No.

652
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:55,808
Not a word. Not a word now!

653
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:57,059
Quiet.

654
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,808
Donations. You want
me to make a donation

655
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:05,142
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

656
00:49:05,726 --> 00:49:07,142
Doc.

657
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:09,684
I'm from the future.

658
00:49:10,851 --> 00:49:13,975
I came here in a time
machine that you invented.

659
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:19,142
Now, I need your help to
get back to the year 1985.

660
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:22,100
My God.

661
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:28,726
Do you know what this means?

662
00:49:30,393 --> 00:49:34,726
It means that this damn
thing doesn't work at all!

663
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,726
Doc, you got to help
me. You are the only one

664
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,142
who knows how your time machine works.

665
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:43,059
Time machine? I haven't
invented any time machine.

666
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:47,392
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

667
00:49:47,477 --> 00:49:50,643
Look at my driver's
license. Expires 1987.

668
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:52,226
Look at my birthday,
for crying out loud!

669
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,309
I haven't even been born yet.

670
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:56,726
And look at this picture.

671
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,809
It's my brother, my sister and me.

672
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:02,184
Look at her sweatshirt,
Doc. "Class of 1984"?

673
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:05,142
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

674
00:50:05,227 --> 00:50:07,476
They cut off your brother's hair.

675
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:10,392
I'm telling the truth,
Doc. You got to believe me.

676
00:50:10,477 --> 00:50:12,559
Then tell me, future boy,

677
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:17,476
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?

678
00:50:17,894 --> 00:50:18,935
Ronald Reagan.

679
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,392
Ronald Reagan? The actor?

680
00:50:22,977 --> 00:50:25,517
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

681
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:29,060
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.

682
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:30,227
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

683
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,517
And Jack Benny is
secretary of the treasury.

684
00:50:32,602 --> 00:50:34,018
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

685
00:50:34,102 --> 00:50:36,185
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

686
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:37,434
Good night, future boy!

687
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:38,893
No, wait, Doc. Doc.

688
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:41,768
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

689
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:43,268
You told me the whole story.

690
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:44,809
You were standing on your toilet

691
00:50:44,894 --> 00:50:45,935
and you were hanging a clock,

692
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:48,227
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

693
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,227
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

694
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:55,310
which is what makes
time travel possible.

695
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:12,559
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

696
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:26,893
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

697
00:51:31,394 --> 00:51:33,185
The flux capacitor.

698
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:52,310
It works!

699
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:56,393
It works!

700
00:51:57,686 --> 00:52:00,393
I finally invent something that works!

701
00:52:01,144 --> 00:52:03,268
You bet your ass it works.

702
00:52:04,186 --> 00:52:07,227
Somehow we've got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

703
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:09,227
We've got to get you home!

704
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,685
Okay, Doc, this is it.

705
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:15,560
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

706
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:19,060
Why, that's me! Look
at me! I'm an old man.

707
00:52:19,144 --> 00:52:20,393
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

708
00:52:20,478 --> 00:52:22,560
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

709
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:24,644
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

710
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,727
What's on Earth is
this thing I'm wearing?

711
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,977
This is a radiation suit.

712
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:30,810
Radiation suit?

713
00:52:30,895 --> 00:52:33,894
Of course. 'Cause of all the
fallout from the atomic wars.

714
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:37,894
This is truly amazing.

715
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:41,227
A portable television studio.

716
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:42,810
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

717
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:45,061
He's gotta look good on television.

718
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:47,560
Whoa. This is it. This is
the part coming up, Doc.

719
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:49,769
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

720
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:50,894
but I need a nuclear reaction

721
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:52,769
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

722
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,644
What did I just say?

723
00:52:58,645 --> 00:52:59,727
This sucker's electrical,

724
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:00,936
but I need a nuclear reaction

725
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,727
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

726
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:05,144
1.21 gigawatts!

727
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:08,852
1.21 gigawatts.

728
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,477
Great Scott!

729
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:16,852
What the hell is a gigawatt?

730
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:21,936
How could I have been so
careless? 1.21 gigawatts!

731
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,727
Tom, how am I going to
generate that kind of power?

732
00:53:24,811 --> 00:53:26,435
It can't be done, can it?

733
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:29,269
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

734
00:53:30,478 --> 00:53:32,228
I'm sure that in 1985,

735
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,477
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

736
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:37,311
but in 1955, it's a
little hard to come by.

737
00:53:37,395 --> 00:53:40,727
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you're stuck here.

738
00:53:40,978 --> 00:53:41,977
Whoa, whoa.

739
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:46,478
Doc, stuck here? I can't be
stuck here. I got a life in 1985.

740
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:47,644
I got a girl.

741
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:48,769
Is she pretty?

742
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:53,269
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

743
00:53:53,354 --> 00:53:57,644
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.

744
00:53:58,895 --> 00:54:01,478
Doc, you're my only hope.

745
00:54:02,145 --> 00:54:05,478
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating

746
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:08,977
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

747
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:11,311
What did you say?

748
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:12,561
A bolt of lightning.

749
00:54:12,645 --> 00:54:13,645
Unfortunately, you never know

750
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:16,852
when or where it's ever going to strike.

751
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:19,727
We do now.

752
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,394
This is it! This is the answer.

753
00:54:29,145 --> 00:54:31,561
It says here that a bolt of lightning

754
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:32,645
is going to strike the clock tower

755
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:35,977
at precisely 10:04 p.m.
Next Saturday night!

756
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,977
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

757
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:47,394
channel it into the flux capacitor,

758
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:50,478
it just might work.

759
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:55,019
Next Saturday night, we're
sending you back to the future!

760
00:54:55,978 --> 00:54:57,853
Okay, all right. Saturday's
good. Saturday's good.

761
00:54:57,937 --> 00:54:59,728
I can spend a week in 1955.

762
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:01,561
I can hang out. You can show me around.

763
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:03,478
Marty, that is completely
out of the question.

764
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:04,895
You must not leave this house.

765
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:06,978
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

766
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:09,645
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

767
00:55:09,729 --> 00:55:11,478
Do you understand?

768
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:14,311
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

769
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:16,144
Marty,

770
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:20,020
have you interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

771
00:55:21,812 --> 00:55:24,937
Yeah, well, I might've sort
of bumped into my parents.

772
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,561
Great Scott!

773
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:28,937
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

774
00:55:32,312 --> 00:55:35,728
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

775
00:55:36,979 --> 00:55:40,187
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

776
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:43,895
Erased from existence.

777
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,561
Whoa.

778
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,394
They really cleaned this
place up. Looks brand-new.

779
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:53,478
Now remember.

780
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:54,811
According to my theory, you interfered

781
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:56,062
with your parents' first meeting.

782
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,394
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

783
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,270
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

784
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:00,394
That's why your older brother's

785
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:01,728
disappearing from that photograph.

786
00:56:01,812 --> 00:56:04,020
Your sister will follow, and
unless you repair the damage,

787
00:56:04,104 --> 00:56:05,312
you'll be next.

788
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,229
Sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.

789
00:56:08,437 --> 00:56:10,312
Which one's your pop?

790
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:12,811
That's him.

791
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:15,686
Okay. Okay, you guys.

792
00:56:17,313 --> 00:56:20,561
Very funny. You guys
are being real mature.

793
00:56:20,646 --> 00:56:22,519
Maybe you were adopted.

794
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:25,145
Okay, real mature, guys.

795
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:27,437
Okay, pick up my books.

796
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,561
McFly.

797
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:30,354
That's Strickland.

798
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:32,895
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

799
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:35,728
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

800
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,895
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

801
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,020
No.

802
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,937
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

803
00:56:42,021 --> 00:56:43,312
I don't know, Doc.

804
00:56:43,396 --> 00:56:45,103
I guess she felt sorry for him

805
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:47,520
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

806
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:50,062
Hit me with the car.

807
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:52,145
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

808
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,562
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

809
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:56,895
Go to it, kid.

810
00:56:57,729 --> 00:57:00,562
Hey, George, buddy.

811
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:03,520
I have been looking all over for you.

812
00:57:03,605 --> 00:57:06,562
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

813
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:07,729
Oh.

814
00:57:07,812 --> 00:57:08,811
Yeah. Good.

815
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:10,895
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

816
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:16,895
Lorraine?

817
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:18,103
Calvin!

818
00:57:19,563 --> 00:57:22,312
I'd like you to meet my
good friend George McFly.

819
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:25,646
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

820
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:27,854
How's your head?

821
00:57:27,938 --> 00:57:29,270
Good. Fine.

822
00:57:29,355 --> 00:57:31,229
Oh. I've been so worried about you

823
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:33,187
ever since you ran off the other night.

824
00:57:33,271 --> 00:57:34,729
Are you okay? Yeah.

825
00:57:35,979 --> 00:57:37,229
I'm sorry. I have to go.

826
00:57:37,313 --> 00:57:38,562
Come on!

827
00:57:39,396 --> 00:57:41,229
Isn't he a dreamboat?

828
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:46,938
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

829
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:48,562
This is more serious than I thought.

830
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:50,604
Apparently, your mother is
amorously infatuated with you,

831
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:52,312
instead of your father.

832
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:54,062
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

833
00:57:54,146 --> 00:57:57,812
Are you trying to tell me that
my mother has got the hots for me?

834
00:57:57,897 --> 00:57:59,021
Precisely.

835
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,145
Whoa. This is heavy.

836
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,812
There's that word again. "Heavy."

837
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,229
Why are things so heavy in the future?

838
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:06,395
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?

839
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,562
What? The only way

840
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:09,063
we're going to get those
two to successfully mate

841
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:10,520
is if they're alone together,

842
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:13,229
so you've got to get your
father and mother to interact

843
00:58:13,313 --> 00:58:15,395
in some sort of social...

844
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,270
What? You mean like a date? Right!

845
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,562
What kind of date? I don't know.

846
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:22,188
What do kids do in the '50s?

847
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:25,063
They're your parents.
You must know them.

848
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:26,270
What are their common interests?

849
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:28,312
What do they like to do together?

850
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:30,395
Nothing.

851
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,687
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

852
00:58:33,772 --> 00:58:35,729
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

853
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:37,188
They're supposed to go to this.

854
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:39,021
That's where they kiss
for the first time.

855
00:58:39,105 --> 00:58:40,479
All right, kid.

856
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:42,146
You stick to your father like glue

857
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:43,771
and make sure he takes
her to that dance.

858
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,979
George, buddy.

859
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:50,063
Remember that girl I
introduced you to, Lorraine?

860
00:58:56,105 --> 00:58:57,729
What are you writing?

861
00:58:57,813 --> 00:58:59,812
Uh... Stories.

862
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:04,188
Science fiction stories about visitors

863
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:07,896
coming down to Earth from other planets.

864
00:59:09,939 --> 00:59:13,604
Get out of town! I didn't
know you did anything creative.

865
00:59:14,105 --> 00:59:15,230
Let me read some.

866
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:16,896
Oh. No, no, no, no.

867
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,812
I never let anybody read my stories.

868
00:59:20,564 --> 00:59:21,812
Why not?

869
00:59:22,231 --> 00:59:24,104
Well, what if they didn't like them?

870
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,646
What if they told me I was no good?

871
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,563
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

872
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,563
No. No, not hard at all.

873
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:39,313
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

874
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:42,313
She really likes you.

875
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:46,230
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

876
00:59:46,314 --> 00:59:48,063
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

877
00:59:48,147 --> 00:59:49,313
Really? Oh, yeah.

878
00:59:49,397 --> 00:59:52,480
All you got to do is go
over there and ask her.

879
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:55,563
What? Right here, right
now, in the cafeteria?

880
00:59:55,648 --> 00:59:56,730
What if she said no?

881
00:59:56,814 --> 01:00:00,271
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

882
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,979
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

883
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:07,480
Who?

884
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,396
Biff.

885
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:13,063
Don't kid around. Come on.

886
01:00:13,147 --> 01:00:14,396
I'm gonna leave.

887
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:16,355
You want it. You know you want it.

888
01:00:16,439 --> 01:00:18,563
You know you want me to give it to you.

889
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,230
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

890
01:00:22,481 --> 01:00:25,230
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

891
01:00:25,314 --> 01:00:27,146
Get your meat hooks off of me.

892
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:28,271
You heard her.

893
01:00:28,356 --> 01:00:31,730
She said, get your meat hooks off.

894
01:00:33,147 --> 01:00:34,396
Please.

895
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,313
So what's it to you, butthead?

896
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:40,688
You know, you been looking for a fight.

897
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:54,647
Since you're new here, I'm
going to cut you a break, today.

898
01:00:56,481 --> 01:01:00,231
So, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here.

899
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,147
George!

900
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:17,521
Why do you keep following me around?

901
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:20,563
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,

902
01:01:20,648 --> 01:01:22,396
if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,

903
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:23,980
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

904
01:01:24,065 --> 01:01:25,521
But I can't go to the dance.

905
01:01:25,606 --> 01:01:28,730
I'll miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

906
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:32,189
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine
wants to go with you.

907
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,397
Give her a break.

908
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:37,647
Look, I'm just not ready to
ask Lorraine out to the dance,

909
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,647
and not you or anybody
else on this planet

910
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:44,314
is going to make me change my mind.

911
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:53,105
Science Fiction Theatre.

912
01:02:24,649 --> 01:02:25,689
Who are you?

913
01:02:31,273 --> 01:02:33,314
Silence, Earthling.

914
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:37,231
My name is Darth Vader.

915
01:02:42,273 --> 01:02:45,731
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

916
01:02:47,815 --> 01:02:48,980
Marty!

917
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:53,231
Marty! Marty!

918
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:54,397
Hey, George, buddy.

919
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:56,856
You weren't at school. What
have you been doing all day?

920
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:59,856
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

921
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:01,397
I have to ask Lorraine out,

922
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:02,564
but I don't know how to do it.

923
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:05,481
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

924
01:03:05,565 --> 01:03:07,606
God! How do you...

925
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,147
What made you change your mind, George?

926
01:03:12,232 --> 01:03:15,147
Last night, Darth Vader
came down from Planet Vulcan

927
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:19,147
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

928
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:22,314
Let's just keep this brain-melting
stuff to ourselves, okay?

929
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,522
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

930
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:25,898
All right, okay. There she is, George.

931
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:27,731
Now just go in there and invite her.

932
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:29,397
Okay. But I don't know what to say.

933
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:30,564
Just say anything, George.

934
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:34,689
Say whatever's natural, the first
thing that comes into your mind.

935
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,232
Nothing's coming to my mind.

936
01:03:37,315 --> 01:03:39,023
Jesus, George, it's a
wonder I was even born.

937
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,065
What? What?

938
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,648
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

939
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:46,314
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

940
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:48,314
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl

941
01:03:48,398 --> 01:03:50,232
you have ever seen in the world.

942
01:03:50,316 --> 01:03:52,273
Girls like that stuff.

943
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:53,648
What are you doing, George?

944
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,522
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

945
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:57,106
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

946
01:03:57,191 --> 01:03:58,648
Can you take care of that? Right.

947
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:20,065
Lou, give me a milk.

948
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,814
Chocolate.

949
01:04:38,982 --> 01:04:44,065
Lorraine. My density
has popped me to you.

950
01:04:45,441 --> 01:04:46,649
What?

951
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:47,898
Oh.

952
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:51,398
What I meant to say was...

953
01:04:51,483 --> 01:04:54,565
Wait a minute. Don't I
know you from somewhere?

954
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:56,106
Yes.

955
01:04:56,399 --> 01:05:00,315
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

956
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:02,607
I'm your density.

957
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,898
I mean,

958
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:07,732
your destiny.

959
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,023
Oh.

960
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,148
Hey, McFly.

961
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:19,482
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

962
01:05:21,982 --> 01:05:24,190
Well, it's going to cost you.

963
01:05:24,566 --> 01:05:26,815
How much money you got on you?

964
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:29,273
How much do you want, Biff?

965
01:05:37,483 --> 01:05:39,065
All right, punk.

966
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:40,148
Now I'm going to...

967
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:41,899
Whoa, whoa, Biff. What's that?

968
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:51,649
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

969
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:52,857
Whoa, whoa.

970
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:54,732
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

971
01:05:54,816 --> 01:05:55,982
Hey!

972
01:05:58,149 --> 01:05:59,232
I'll get it
back to you, all right?

973
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:01,982
You broke it!

974
01:06:02,316 --> 01:06:03,398
Come back here!

975
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:07,357
Wow. Look at him go!

976
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:10,482
Get him!

977
01:06:23,816 --> 01:06:25,982
To the car! Go! Go!

978
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:33,523
What's that thing he's on?

979
01:06:33,608 --> 01:06:35,066
It's a board with wheels.

980
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,732
He's an absolute dream.

981
01:06:36,816 --> 01:06:38,024
Come on, come on!

982
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:39,649
Look out for the car!

983
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,649
Whoa!

984
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:14,774
I'm going to ram him.

985
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,316
Shit!

986
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:35,982
Ooh!

987
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:50,233
Thanks a lot, kid.

988
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,775
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

989
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:54,899
Where does he come from?

990
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:56,858
Yeah, where does he live?

991
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,149
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

992
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:08,316
Oh, my God.

993
01:08:08,734 --> 01:08:11,816
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

994
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:13,566
Run for it, Marty!

995
01:08:18,275 --> 01:08:19,650
Oh, my God.

996
01:08:20,442 --> 01:08:23,358
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

997
01:08:23,442 --> 01:08:24,816
Run for it, Marty!

998
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:27,191
Doc?

999
01:08:27,943 --> 01:08:30,900
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

1000
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,399
Fascinating device, this video unit.

1001
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,067
Listen, Doc.

1002
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,108
You know, there's something

1003
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,358
I haven't told you about the night

1004
01:08:39,484 --> 01:08:40,775
we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.

1005
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:42,150
No man should know too
much about his own destiny.

1006
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:43,608
You don't understand. I do understand.

1007
01:08:43,692 --> 01:08:44,900
If I know too much about my own future,

1008
01:08:44,984 --> 01:08:46,399
I can endanger my own existence.

1009
01:08:46,484 --> 01:08:48,816
Just as you've endangered yours.

1010
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:52,691
You're right. Now...

1011
01:08:52,776 --> 01:08:55,650
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1012
01:08:55,734 --> 01:08:57,483
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

1013
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,900
I didn't have time to build
it to scale or paint it.

1014
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:01,900
It's good. Thank you. Thank you.

1015
01:09:03,193 --> 01:09:04,399
Okay, now.

1016
01:09:04,484 --> 01:09:06,691
We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

1017
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,608
from the top of the clock tower

1018
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:10,317
down, suspending it over the street

1019
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,983
between these two lamp posts.

1020
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:15,067
Meanwhile, we've
outfitted the time vehicle

1021
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,608
with this big pole and hook,

1022
01:09:16,692 --> 01:09:19,650
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

1023
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:25,234
At the calculated moment, you
start off from down the street,

1024
01:09:25,318 --> 01:09:26,566
driving directly toward the cable,

1025
01:09:26,651 --> 01:09:29,566
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1026
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:33,275
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. This Saturday night,

1027
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,983
lightning will strike the clock
tower, electrifying the cable

1028
01:09:37,068 --> 01:09:39,317
just as the connecting
hook makes contact

1029
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:43,025
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

1030
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:45,567
and sending you back to 1985.

1031
01:09:45,651 --> 01:09:47,691
All right, now. Watch this.

1032
01:09:47,776 --> 01:09:49,691
You wind up the car and release it.

1033
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:53,691
I'll simulate the lightning.

1034
01:10:01,984 --> 01:10:03,150
Ready.

1035
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:14,025
Set.

1036
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:20,317
Release.

1037
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,859
You're instilling me with
a lot of confidence, Doc.

1038
01:10:40,943 --> 01:10:42,317
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the lightning.

1039
01:10:42,401 --> 01:10:44,983
You take care of your pop.

1040
01:10:46,151 --> 01:10:49,150
By the way, what happened
today? Did he ask her out?

1041
01:10:49,235 --> 01:10:50,359
I think so.

1042
01:10:50,443 --> 01:10:51,484
What did she say?

1043
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:01,901
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!

1044
01:11:01,985 --> 01:11:04,234
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

1045
01:11:17,568 --> 01:11:20,026
Hi, Cal... Marty.

1046
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,943
Mom. Lorraine.

1047
01:11:23,485 --> 01:11:25,692
How did you know I was here?

1048
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:28,151
I followed you.

1049
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:30,984
Oh. This is my doc...

1050
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:34,151
My uncle, Doc Brown.

1051
01:11:35,485 --> 01:11:36,734
Hi. Hi.

1052
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:42,984
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

1053
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,567
but I was kind of
wondering if you'd ask me

1054
01:11:47,652 --> 01:11:51,484
to the Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

1055
01:11:54,152 --> 01:11:57,360
Wow, you mean... You
mean nobody's asked you?

1056
01:11:58,027 --> 01:12:01,109
No. Not yet.

1057
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,360
What about George?

1058
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:06,235
George McFly?

1059
01:12:08,777 --> 01:12:12,776
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

1060
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:17,776
Well, I think a man should be strong,

1061
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:21,943
so he can stand up for himself

1062
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:25,235
and protect the woman he loves.

1063
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:31,318
Don't you?

1064
01:12:32,818 --> 01:12:33,901
Yeah.

1065
01:12:34,361 --> 01:12:36,360
I still don't understand.

1066
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:39,526
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

1067
01:12:39,611 --> 01:12:42,360
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1068
01:12:42,444 --> 01:12:45,109
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

1069
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,109
She just doesn't know it yet.

1070
01:12:47,194 --> 01:12:48,193
That's why we got to show her

1071
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:50,235
that you, George McFly, are a fighter.

1072
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:52,235
You're somebody who's
gonna stand up for yourself,

1073
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:53,777
somebody who's gonna protect her.

1074
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,068
Yeah, but I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1075
01:12:57,152 --> 01:12:59,901
Look, you're not going to
be picking a fight, Dad.

1076
01:12:59,985 --> 01:13:02,193
Daddy-o.

1077
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,568
You're coming to her rescue, right?

1078
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:05,818
Okay, let's go over the plan again.

1079
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,652
8:55, where are you going to be?

1080
01:13:07,736 --> 01:13:09,318
I'm going to be at the dance.

1081
01:13:09,402 --> 01:13:10,443
Right. And where am I going to be?

1082
01:13:10,527 --> 01:13:12,526
You're gonna be in the car with her.

1083
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:14,068
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,

1084
01:13:14,152 --> 01:13:15,568
she's going to get very angry with me.

1085
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:18,068
Why is she going to get angry with you?

1086
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:20,485
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

1087
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:22,818
when guys take advantage of them.

1088
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:27,068
You mean you're going
to go touch her on her...

1089
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,610
No. No, George, look.

1090
01:13:30,444 --> 01:13:32,401
It's just an act, right?

1091
01:13:32,694 --> 01:13:36,193
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1092
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:39,818
You see us struggling in the car.

1093
01:13:40,236 --> 01:13:43,401
You walk up, you open
the door, and you say...

1094
01:13:45,028 --> 01:13:46,777
Your line, George.

1095
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,235
Oh!

1096
01:13:49,903 --> 01:13:52,735
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

1097
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,401
You really think I ought to swear?

1098
01:13:56,486 --> 01:13:57,485
Yes, definitely.

1099
01:13:57,569 --> 01:13:59,194
God damn it, George, swear.

1100
01:13:59,277 --> 01:14:01,276
Okay. So, now you come up.

1101
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:02,485
You punch me in the stomach.

1102
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:04,360
I'm out for the count, right?

1103
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:07,652
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

1104
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:09,944
You make it sound so easy.

1105
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,485
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

1106
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:13,818
George, there's nothing to be scared of.

1107
01:14:13,903 --> 01:14:16,443
All it takes is a
little self-confidence.

1108
01:14:16,527 --> 01:14:19,236
You know, if you put your mind to it,

1109
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,777
you can accomplish anything.

1110
01:14:23,402 --> 01:14:25,610
...Hill Valley area
weather this Saturday night.

1111
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,693
Mostly clear, with
some scattered clouds.

1112
01:14:28,778 --> 01:14:30,485
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

1113
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:32,485
Are you sure about this storm?

1114
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:37,485
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

1115
01:14:37,986 --> 01:14:40,652
You know, Marty, I'm going
to be very sad to see you go.

1116
01:14:40,736 --> 01:14:41,944
You've really made a
difference in my life.

1117
01:14:42,028 --> 01:14:44,152
You've given me something to shoot for.

1118
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:48,402
Just knowing that I'm going
to be around to see 1985.

1119
01:14:48,487 --> 01:14:50,402
That I'm going to succeed in this!

1120
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:54,027
That I'm going to have a
chance to travel through time!

1121
01:14:59,487 --> 01:15:02,152
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1122
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:05,194
about everything that's
happened in the past few days.

1123
01:15:05,278 --> 01:15:07,860
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

1124
01:15:09,195 --> 01:15:11,027
I'm really going to miss you.

1125
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:16,569
Doc, about the future...

1126
01:15:16,654 --> 01:15:17,735
No!

1127
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:20,735
Marty! We've already agreed

1128
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:22,110
that having information about the future

1129
01:15:22,195 --> 01:15:23,653
can be extremely dangerous.

1130
01:15:23,737 --> 01:15:25,236
Even if your intentions are good,

1131
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,277
it can backfire drastically.

1132
01:15:28,528 --> 01:15:29,736
Whatever you've got to tell me,

1133
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:32,902
I'll find out through the
natural course of time.

1134
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:35,902
"Dear Dr. Brown.

1135
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:39,110
"On the night that I go back in time,

1136
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,319
"you will be

1137
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:44,194
"shot by terrorists.

1138
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,778
"Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

1139
01:15:47,862 --> 01:15:50,319
"to prevent this terrible disaster.

1140
01:15:51,737 --> 01:15:53,444
"Your friend,

1141
01:15:54,487 --> 01:15:55,736
"Marty."

1142
01:16:05,153 --> 01:16:08,110
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

1143
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:11,110
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

1144
01:16:12,946 --> 01:16:13,945
What you got under here?

1145
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,028
No! Don't touch that!

1146
01:16:15,111 --> 01:16:17,903
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

1147
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:20,194
You got a permit for that?

1148
01:16:20,278 --> 01:16:21,569
Of course I do.

1149
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:32,153
Just a second. Let me
see if I can find it here.

1150
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,819
Do you mind if we park for a while?

1151
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:32,028
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

1152
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:33,111
Huh?

1153
01:17:33,196 --> 01:17:35,903
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

1154
01:17:35,987 --> 01:17:37,903
It's not like I've never parked before.

1155
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:39,986
What?

1156
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:43,528
Marty, you seem so
nervous. Is something wrong?

1157
01:17:43,613 --> 01:17:46,903
No.

1158
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:54,070
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

1159
01:17:54,529 --> 01:17:56,861
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

1160
01:17:56,946 --> 01:17:59,861
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

1161
01:17:59,946 --> 01:18:00,903
Why not?

1162
01:18:00,987 --> 01:18:02,028
Because you...

1163
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:05,528
You might regret it later in life.

1164
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:08,487
Marty, don't be such a square.

1165
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,487
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

1166
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,487
Jeez, you smoke, too?

1167
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:21,862
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

1168
01:18:33,071 --> 01:18:34,403
We're going to take a little break,

1169
01:18:34,488 --> 01:18:35,986
but we'll be back in a while,

1170
01:18:36,071 --> 01:18:38,654
so don't nobody go nowhere.

1171
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,320
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

1172
01:18:59,571 --> 01:19:00,946
Lorraine.

1173
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:06,029
Have you ever been in a situation

1174
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:07,904
where you knew you had
to act a certain way,

1175
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:10,154
but when you got there, you didn't know

1176
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:11,987
if you could go through with it?

1177
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:15,528
You mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

1178
01:19:15,613 --> 01:19:16,862
Sort of.

1179
01:19:17,655 --> 01:19:20,320
I think I know exactly what you mean.

1180
01:19:21,155 --> 01:19:22,445
You do?

1181
01:19:22,947 --> 01:19:25,570
You know what I do in those situations?

1182
01:19:25,655 --> 01:19:26,779
What?

1183
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:27,904
I don't worry.

1184
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:49,528
This is all wrong. I
don't know what it is.

1185
01:19:51,197 --> 01:19:54,654
But when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing

1186
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:57,820
my brother.

1187
01:19:58,113 --> 01:20:00,820
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

1188
01:20:00,905 --> 01:20:04,904
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

1189
01:20:06,738 --> 01:20:08,446
Somebody's coming.

1190
01:20:12,364 --> 01:20:16,571
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car, you son of a bitch.

1191
01:20:16,655 --> 01:20:19,946
And I'm going to take it
out of your ass. Hold him.

1192
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:23,279
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

1193
01:20:24,113 --> 01:20:26,571
Well, look-ey what we have here.

1194
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:32,987
No, no! You're staying right
here with me. Come on, Lorraine.

1195
01:20:33,072 --> 01:20:34,112
Let me go!

1196
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:35,446
Leave her alone, you bastard!

1197
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,363
Take him in back, all
right? I'll be right there.

1198
01:20:37,447 --> 01:20:40,529
Just admit that
you want it. Come on.

1199
01:20:40,614 --> 01:20:42,904
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

1200
01:20:49,656 --> 01:20:50,780
Hey, let's put him in there.

1201
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:52,238
Yeah!

1202
01:20:53,656 --> 01:20:55,987
That's for messing up my hair.

1203
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:58,154
What the hell are you doing to my car?

1204
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,696
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1205
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,863
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

1206
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:08,987
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

1207
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:11,655
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

1208
01:21:11,739 --> 01:21:13,571
Get home to your mama, boy.

1209
01:21:13,656 --> 01:21:14,738
Biff!

1210
01:21:14,822 --> 01:21:15,905
Hurry, Biff!

1211
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:18,279
Let me out of here!

1212
01:21:20,072 --> 01:21:21,571
Reginald, where are your keys?

1213
01:21:21,656 --> 01:21:23,821
The keys are in the trunk.

1214
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,404
Say that again?

1215
01:21:25,489 --> 01:21:27,321
I said, the keys are in here.

1216
01:21:41,031 --> 01:21:42,321
Come on!

1217
01:21:44,405 --> 01:21:47,155
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

1218
01:21:48,906 --> 01:21:50,279
Oh.

1219
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,988
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1220
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,321
George, help me! Please!

1221
01:21:56,405 --> 01:21:59,279
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

1222
01:22:00,322 --> 01:22:01,321
Please, George.

1223
01:22:01,405 --> 01:22:02,488
Are you deaf, McFly?

1224
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:04,655
Close the door and beat it.

1225
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,821
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

1226
01:22:11,572 --> 01:22:13,363
All right, McFly.

1227
01:22:16,614 --> 01:22:20,239
You're asking for it, and
now you're going to get it.

1228
01:22:21,656 --> 01:22:23,113
Biff, stop it!

1229
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:26,405
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1230
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:29,155
Biff, no!

1231
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:32,280
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1232
01:22:33,614 --> 01:22:35,905
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

1233
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:37,447
Whose are these? Mine.

1234
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:39,447
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1235
01:22:40,781 --> 01:22:42,655
You're going to break his arm!

1236
01:22:43,323 --> 01:22:46,447
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1237
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:48,988
Let him go! Let him go!

1238
01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:23,697
Are you okay?

1239
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,072
Who is that guy?

1240
01:23:46,156 --> 01:23:47,364
That's George McFly.

1241
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,239
That's George McFly?

1242
01:23:53,323 --> 01:23:54,614
Excuse me.

1243
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:07,364
The storm.

1244
01:24:09,323 --> 01:24:12,031
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

1245
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:13,530
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

1246
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:14,739
He can't play with his hand like that,

1247
01:24:14,823 --> 01:24:15,948
and we can't play without him.

1248
01:24:16,032 --> 01:24:18,489
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.

1249
01:24:18,573 --> 01:24:20,739
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

1250
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:22,530
And if there's no
music, they can't dance.

1251
01:24:22,615 --> 01:24:23,906
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

1252
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:26,364
If they can't kiss, they can't
fall in love and I'm history.

1253
01:24:26,448 --> 01:24:27,614
Hey, man, the dance is over

1254
01:24:27,698 --> 01:24:30,239
unless you know somebody
else that can play the guitar.

1255
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,031
This is for all you lovers out there.

1256
01:24:42,615 --> 01:24:46,656
Earth angel, Earth angel

1257
01:24:47,406 --> 01:24:50,031
Will you be mine?

1258
01:24:50,615 --> 01:24:53,281
My darling dear

1259
01:24:54,074 --> 01:24:55,906
George, aren't you going to kiss me?

1260
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,489
I don't know.

1261
01:24:59,282 --> 01:25:01,406
Scram, McFly. I'm cutting in.

1262
01:25:08,407 --> 01:25:12,365
Earth angel, Earth angel

1263
01:25:13,032 --> 01:25:14,864
The one I adore

1264
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:16,948
Hey, boy, you all right?

1265
01:25:18,074 --> 01:25:19,531
I can't play.

1266
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:20,697
George!

1267
01:25:38,157 --> 01:25:39,406
George!

1268
01:25:40,823 --> 01:25:41,989
George.

1269
01:25:45,032 --> 01:25:46,448
Excuse me.

1270
01:25:55,865 --> 01:25:58,490
The vision of your happiness

1271
01:26:00,658 --> 01:26:03,864
Earth angel, Earth angel

1272
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:07,740
Please be mine

1273
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:10,448
My darling dear

1274
01:26:10,783 --> 01:26:13,823
Love you for all time

1275
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:17,865
I'm just a fool

1276
01:26:18,949 --> 01:26:21,989
A fool in love

1277
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:26,657
with you

1278
01:26:33,491 --> 01:26:37,406
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

1279
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:39,406
No. I got to go.

1280
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,990
Come on, man. Let's do
something that really cooks.

1281
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:45,865
Something that cooks.

1282
01:26:51,241 --> 01:26:52,281
All right.

1283
01:26:52,366 --> 01:26:53,365
All right!

1284
01:26:57,366 --> 01:26:58,740
All right.

1285
01:26:59,658 --> 01:27:03,074
All right, this is an oldie, but...

1286
01:27:05,075 --> 01:27:08,448
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

1287
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:12,740
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

1288
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:15,865
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

1289
01:27:32,783 --> 01:27:35,615
Way down in
Louisiana Down in New Orleans

1290
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,448
Way back up in the woods
among the evergreens

1291
01:27:38,574 --> 01:27:41,366
There stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood

1292
01:27:41,491 --> 01:27:44,074
Where lived a country boy
name of Johnny B. Goode

1293
01:27:44,408 --> 01:27:46,823
He never ever learned
to read or write so well

1294
01:27:47,075 --> 01:27:49,490
He could play the guitar
just like he's ringing a bell

1295
01:27:49,616 --> 01:27:53,573
Go, go Go, Johnny, go, go

1296
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:56,157
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1297
01:27:57,033 --> 01:27:58,573
Go, Johnny, go, go

1298
01:27:58,658 --> 01:28:01,282
Hey, George, I heard you
laid out Biff. Nice going.

1299
01:28:01,367 --> 01:28:03,657
George, you ever think of
running for class president?

1300
01:28:03,741 --> 01:28:06,157
Johnny B. Goode

1301
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,157
Go, Johnny, go, go

1302
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:13,907
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1303
01:28:13,991 --> 01:28:16,740
Go, Johnny, go, go

1304
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:19,032
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1305
01:28:20,617 --> 01:28:22,491
Johnny B. Goode

1306
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:27,574
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

1307
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:30,241
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1308
01:28:30,325 --> 01:28:33,074
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1309
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:35,032
Well, listen to this.

1310
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:47,491
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

1311
01:29:48,825 --> 01:29:50,449
But your kids are going to love it.

1312
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,075
Lorraine.

1313
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,741
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1314
01:29:58,825 --> 01:30:00,407
Yeah.

1315
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:02,407
I hope you don't mind,

1316
01:30:02,492 --> 01:30:04,532
but George asked if
he could take me home.

1317
01:30:04,784 --> 01:30:07,699
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.

1318
01:30:07,784 --> 01:30:09,200
I had a feeling about you two.

1319
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:11,616
I have a feeling, too.

1320
01:30:11,992 --> 01:30:13,367
Listen, I got to go,

1321
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:18,158
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been educational.

1322
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:21,658
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1323
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:24,075
I guarantee it.

1324
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:27,574
Well, Marty, I want to thank
you for all your good advice.

1325
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:29,991
I'll never forget it.

1326
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,283
Right, George.

1327
01:30:33,659 --> 01:30:37,158
Well, good luck, you guys.

1328
01:30:38,742 --> 01:30:39,824
Oh!

1329
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:45,075
One other thing. If
you guys ever have kids,

1330
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:47,575
and one of them, when
he's eight years old,

1331
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:50,658
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1332
01:30:51,992 --> 01:30:53,617
go easy on him.

1333
01:30:54,618 --> 01:30:55,908
Okay.

1334
01:31:00,784 --> 01:31:03,617
Marty. Such a nice name.

1335
01:31:09,576 --> 01:31:11,700
Damn! Where is that kid?

1336
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:16,158
Damn!

1337
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:19,991
Damn! Damn!

1338
01:31:27,826 --> 01:31:30,700
You're late! Do you
have no concept of time?

1339
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:33,158
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1340
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:36,158
Do you think I'm going
back in that zoot suit?

1341
01:31:36,243 --> 01:31:38,909
The old man really
came through. It worked.

1342
01:31:38,992 --> 01:31:41,075
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1343
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:42,242
I didn't know he had it in him.

1344
01:31:42,326 --> 01:31:45,533
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1345
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:48,075
Never?

1346
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:49,909
No. Why? What's the matter?

1347
01:31:50,993 --> 01:31:54,700
All right! Let's set
your destination time.

1348
01:31:59,451 --> 01:32:01,784
This is the exact time you left.

1349
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,617
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

1350
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:10,700
It'll be like you never left.

1351
01:32:12,451 --> 01:32:16,867
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1352
01:32:16,952 --> 01:32:18,825
That's where you'll start from.

1353
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,242
I've calculated the precise distance,

1354
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:23,992
taking into account
the acceleration speed

1355
01:32:24,077 --> 01:32:25,825
and wind resistance retroactive

1356
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:28,533
from the moment the lightning strikes,

1357
01:32:28,618 --> 01:32:33,117
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1358
01:32:33,493 --> 01:32:35,867
When this alarm goes
off, you hit the gas.

1359
01:32:35,952 --> 01:32:37,034
Right.

1360
01:32:43,826 --> 01:32:46,867
Well, I guess that's everything.

1361
01:32:51,077 --> 01:32:52,533
Thanks.

1362
01:32:52,618 --> 01:32:53,825
Thank you.

1363
01:32:58,826 --> 01:33:00,951
See you in about 30 years.

1364
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,992
I hope so.

1365
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,201
Don't worry!

1366
01:33:07,868 --> 01:33:09,575
As long as you hit that wire

1367
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:12,742
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

1368
01:33:12,826 --> 01:33:15,825
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower

1369
01:33:18,285 --> 01:33:19,409
everything will be fine.

1370
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:20,659
Right.

1371
01:33:29,535 --> 01:33:31,493
What's the meaning of this?

1372
01:33:31,577 --> 01:33:33,243
You'll find out in 30 years.

1373
01:33:33,327 --> 01:33:35,409
It's about the future, isn't it?

1374
01:33:35,494 --> 01:33:36,576
It's information about the future.

1375
01:33:36,661 --> 01:33:38,201
Wait a minute.

1376
01:33:38,285 --> 01:33:40,201
I warned you about this, kid.

1377
01:33:40,285 --> 01:33:43,117
The consequences could be disastrous!

1378
01:33:43,202 --> 01:33:45,618
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

1379
01:33:45,702 --> 01:33:47,284
Your life depends on it!

1380
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:48,534
No!

1381
01:33:48,993 --> 01:33:52,326
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1382
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:54,618
In that case, I'll
tell you straight out.

1383
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:00,785
Great Scott!

1384
01:34:08,702 --> 01:34:11,743
You get the cable, I'll
throw the rope down to you.

1385
01:34:11,827 --> 01:34:13,618
Right! I got it!

1386
01:34:47,786 --> 01:34:49,035
Doc!

1387
01:34:56,661 --> 01:34:58,243
Come on, come on. Let's go!

1388
01:34:58,327 --> 01:35:00,993
All right! Take it up!

1389
01:35:04,203 --> 01:35:05,326
Go!

1390
01:35:12,369 --> 01:35:13,368
Doc!

1391
01:35:13,452 --> 01:35:14,493
What?

1392
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:17,993
I have to tell you about the future.

1393
01:35:18,203 --> 01:35:19,244
What?

1394
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:22,576
I have to tell you about the future!

1395
01:35:22,661 --> 01:35:23,993
What?

1396
01:35:24,078 --> 01:35:28,910
On the night I go back
in time, you get...

1397
01:35:32,411 --> 01:35:33,660
Doc!

1398
01:35:42,911 --> 01:35:44,118
Go!

1399
01:35:44,994 --> 01:35:46,077
No, Doc!

1400
01:35:46,161 --> 01:35:47,410
Look at the time!

1401
01:35:47,495 --> 01:35:51,494
You've got less than four
minutes. Please, hurry!

1402
01:36:03,078 --> 01:36:04,410
Yeah!

1403
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:00,869
Damn it, Doc! Why did you
have to tear up that letter?

1404
01:37:00,954 --> 01:37:02,911
If I only had more time.

1405
01:37:05,912 --> 01:37:08,285
Wait a minute. I got
all the time I want.

1406
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:11,953
I got a time machine. I can
just go back early and warn him.

1407
01:37:12,037 --> 01:37:14,577
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1408
01:37:16,703 --> 01:37:21,410
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1409
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,994
Engine running. All right.

1410
01:37:26,787 --> 01:37:28,827
No. No, no.

1411
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:32,577
Come on. Not this
time. Come on. Come on.

1412
01:38:42,954 --> 01:38:44,245
Come on.

1413
01:38:46,329 --> 01:38:49,453
Here we go. Here we
go. This time. Come on.

1414
01:38:50,745 --> 01:38:53,620
Please. Please. Come on!

1415
01:40:31,871 --> 01:40:33,246
Doc.

1416
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:11,412
Crazy drunk driver.

1417
01:42:21,914 --> 01:42:23,329
Whoo!

1418
01:42:26,538 --> 01:42:28,788
All right. Fred.

1419
01:42:30,288 --> 01:42:33,080
You look great. Everything looks great.

1420
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:38,329
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1421
01:42:41,997 --> 01:42:46,746
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

1422
01:43:00,497 --> 01:43:01,829
Libyans.

1423
01:43:24,455 --> 01:43:25,496
No!

1424
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:28,330
You bastard!

1425
01:43:41,664 --> 01:43:42,996
Go!

1426
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:19,455
Doc! Doc!

1427
01:44:24,914 --> 01:44:27,080
No! No!

1428
01:44:41,997 --> 01:44:43,497
You're alive.

1429
01:44:52,706 --> 01:44:54,330
Bulletproof vest?

1430
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:57,330
How did you know?

1431
01:44:58,122 --> 01:45:00,538
I never got a chance to tell you.

1432
01:45:14,082 --> 01:45:18,122
What about all that talk about
screwing up future events?

1433
01:45:18,206 --> 01:45:20,288
The space-time continuum?

1434
01:45:20,748 --> 01:45:23,664
Well, I figured, what the hell?

1435
01:45:33,873 --> 01:45:35,830
So, how far ahead are you going?

1436
01:45:35,915 --> 01:45:38,914
About 30 years. It's
a nice, round number.

1437
01:45:38,998 --> 01:45:43,455
Look me up when you get there,
all right? Guess I'll be about 47.

1438
01:45:43,539 --> 01:45:44,789
I will.

1439
01:45:45,207 --> 01:45:46,622
Take care.

1440
01:45:47,373 --> 01:45:48,580
You, too.

1441
01:45:48,665 --> 01:45:50,997
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1442
01:45:51,498 --> 01:45:54,497
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1443
01:45:55,207 --> 01:45:56,497
You bet.

1444
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:03,039
What a nightmare.

1445
01:47:14,374 --> 01:47:17,331
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

1446
01:47:17,415 --> 01:47:19,498
Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

1447
01:47:19,582 --> 01:47:21,122
second of all, somebody named Greg

1448
01:47:21,207 --> 01:47:23,081
or Craig called you
just a little while ago.

1449
01:47:23,165 --> 01:47:24,748
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

1450
01:47:24,832 --> 01:47:27,539
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

1451
01:47:27,624 --> 01:47:28,748
Hey.

1452
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:31,498
What the hell is this?

1453
01:47:32,249 --> 01:47:33,331
Breakfast.

1454
01:47:33,832 --> 01:47:36,248
Did you sleep in your
clothes again last night?

1455
01:47:36,332 --> 01:47:37,665
Yeah. I...

1456
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:41,206
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

1457
01:47:41,499 --> 01:47:44,331
Marty, I always wear
a suit to the office.

1458
01:47:46,041 --> 01:47:47,873
You all right? Yeah.

1459
01:47:48,666 --> 01:47:49,748
I think we
need a rematch, George.

1460
01:47:49,832 --> 01:47:50,873
A rematch?

1461
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:51,998
Why? Were you cheating?

1462
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:53,082
No.

1463
01:47:53,165 --> 01:47:55,040
Hello. Good morning.

1464
01:47:57,124 --> 01:47:58,623
Mom! Dad!

1465
01:47:58,999 --> 01:48:00,581
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?

1466
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:04,665
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1467
01:48:04,999 --> 01:48:07,539
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1468
01:48:08,999 --> 01:48:11,082
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1469
01:48:11,999 --> 01:48:13,373
Good morning, Dave. Linda.

1470
01:48:13,457 --> 01:48:14,831
Good morning, Mom.

1471
01:48:14,916 --> 01:48:17,414
Marty, I almost
forgot. Jennifer Parker called.

1472
01:48:17,499 --> 01:48:21,123
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1473
01:48:21,666 --> 01:48:23,665
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1474
01:48:23,749 --> 01:48:25,706
What? What, Ma?

1475
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,165
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?

1476
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,915
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1477
01:48:29,999 --> 01:48:32,665
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1478
01:48:32,749 --> 01:48:33,873
The car's wrecked.

1479
01:48:33,958 --> 01:48:35,539
Wrecked? Wrecked?

1480
01:48:35,624 --> 01:48:36,748
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1481
01:48:36,832 --> 01:48:37,831
Quiet down.

1482
01:48:37,916 --> 01:48:39,415
I'm sure the car is fine.

1483
01:48:39,499 --> 01:48:41,748
Why am I always the last
one to know about these things?

1484
01:48:41,832 --> 01:48:44,915
See? There's Biff out
there waxing it right now.

1485
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,748
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that

1486
01:48:46,832 --> 01:48:49,665
we get two coats of wax
this time, not just one.

1487
01:48:49,749 --> 01:48:51,332
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1488
01:48:51,416 --> 01:48:53,998
Now, Biff, don't con me.

1489
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,540
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1490
01:48:57,624 --> 01:49:00,706
I meant I was just
starting on the second coat.

1491
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:05,623
Biff. What a character. Always
trying to get away with something.

1492
01:49:06,124 --> 01:49:09,082
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.

1493
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:11,249
Although, if it wasn't for him...

1494
01:49:11,333 --> 01:49:12,915
We never would have fallen in love.

1495
01:49:12,999 --> 01:49:14,457
That's right.

1496
01:49:14,999 --> 01:49:17,706
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1497
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,582
Oh, hi, Marty. I think
it's your new book.

1498
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:26,998
Honey! Your first novel.

1499
01:49:27,083 --> 01:49:28,123
Like I've always told you,

1500
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:31,123
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1501
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:33,707
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.

1502
01:49:33,792 --> 01:49:35,582
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1503
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:37,332
Keys?

1504
01:49:53,667 --> 01:49:55,290
How about a ride, mister?

1505
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,499
Jennifer.

1506
01:49:57,458 --> 01:50:01,582
Oh, are you a sight for sore
eyes! Let me look at you.

1507
01:50:02,333 --> 01:50:05,207
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1508
01:50:05,291 --> 01:50:06,707
I haven't.

1509
01:50:07,291 --> 01:50:10,540
You okay? Is everything all right?

1510
01:50:13,833 --> 01:50:14,958
Oh, yeah.

1511
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:18,958
Everything is great.

1512
01:50:33,167 --> 01:50:37,415
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

1513
01:50:38,208 --> 01:50:39,415
Where?

1514
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,666
Back to the future.

1515
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:47,415
Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?

1516
01:50:48,416 --> 01:50:49,499
I need fuel.

1517
01:50:52,959 --> 01:50:55,374
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1518
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:57,499
No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay?

1519
01:50:57,583 --> 01:50:59,582
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

1520
01:50:59,667 --> 01:51:02,916
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1521
01:51:02,1000 --> 01:51:04,582
Wait a minute, Doc. What
are you talking about?

1522
01:51:04,667 --> 01:51:06,707
What happens to us in the future?

1523
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:08,540
Do we become assholes or something?

1524
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:09,749
No, no, no, no, Marty.

1525
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:11,582
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

1526
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:13,124
It's your kids, Marty.

1527
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,457
Something has got to
be done about your kids.

1528
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:24,916
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

1529
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,166
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
