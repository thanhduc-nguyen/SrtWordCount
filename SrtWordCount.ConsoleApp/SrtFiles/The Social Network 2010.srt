1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>There are more people
with genius IQs in China</i>

2
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,188
<i>than people of any kind
in the United States.</i>

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,981
<i>- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.</i>

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,400
- What accounts for that?
- A lot of people live in China.

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,194
But here's my question.

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,655
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,323
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,201
- They take SATs in China?
- They don't. I'm not talking about China.

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,369
I'm talking about me.

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,912
- You got a 1600?
- Yes.

11
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,248
I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,459
- You got nothing wrong?
- I could row crew, or invent a $25 PC.

13
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,836
Or get into a final club.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,170
Or get into a final club.

15
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,674
From a woman's perspective, not singing
in an a cappella group is good.

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,385
- This is serious.
- I do like guys who row crew.

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,220
Well, I can't do that.

18
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,181
- I was kidding.
- Yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

19
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,142
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying now.

20
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,060
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

21
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,354
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, delusional?

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:07,066
Sometimes you say two things at once.
I'm not sure which one to aim at.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,069
- But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
- No.

24
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,363
They're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

25
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,991
You said you like guys who row crew.
I assumed you'd met one.

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,037
I guess I meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

27
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,290
- Okay.
- Should we get something to eat?

28
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,333
Would you like
to talk about something else?

29
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,545
No, just since the beginning
of the conversation about finals club,

30
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,506
I think I may have missed a birthday.

31
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,551
There are really more people in China
with genius IQs than the population...?

32
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,845
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club...

33
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,889
- Roosevelt punched the Porc.
- Which one?

34
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,682
The Porcellian, the Porc. It's the best.

35
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,725
Which Roosevelt?

36
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,643
Theodore.

37
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:47,023
They send a bus to pick up girls who want
to party with the next Fed chairman?

38
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,275
You can see why
it's so important to get in.

39
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,809
Which is easiest to get into?

40
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,697
Why would you ask me that?

41
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,240
I was just asking.

42
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,618
None of them. That's the point.

43
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,495
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

44
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,080
and won't come close to getting in.

45
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,249
The ability to make money
doesn't impress anybody.

46
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,334
Must be nice.

47
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,211
He made $300,000 in a summer?

48
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,088
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

49
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,299
You read weather,
predict the price of heating oil.

50
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,801
You think the final club
that's easiest to get into

51
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,386
is where I'll have the best chance.

52
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,347
I... What?

53
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,557
You asked me which was easiest to get into

54
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,060
because you think
that's where I'll have the best chance.

55
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,895
The one that's easiest to get into

56
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,189
would be
where anybody has the best chance.

57
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,025
You didn't ask which was best,
you asked which was easiest.

58
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,820
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

59
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,240
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

60
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,659
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

61
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,077
You have finals clubs OCD.

62
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,996
See someone about it
who will prescribe you medication.

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,499
You don't care
if the side effects may include blindness.

64
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,875
Final clubs.

65
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,711
Not "finals clubs."

66
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,089
There's a difference between
being obsessed and motivated.

67
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,967
Yes. There is.

68
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,011
- That was cryptic. You do speak in code.
- I didn't mean to be cryptic.

69
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,807
I need to do something substantial
to get the attention of the clubs.

70
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,684
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

71
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,186
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

72
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,938
Roosevelt wasn't elected president

73
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,856
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

74
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,192
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

75
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,113
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

76
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,907
- Did you really just say that?
- I was kidding.

77
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,368
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

78
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,037
I'll be straightforward.
You might want to be more supportive.

79
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,749
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings.

80
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,083
You'll meet people
you wouldn't normally meet.

81
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,506
You would do that for me?

82
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,049
We're dating.

83
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,009
Okay.

84
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,264
I'll be straightforward with you
and tell you that we're not anymore.

85
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,850
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

86
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,851
Is this a joke?

87
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,978
- No, it's not.
- You're breaking up with me?

88
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,148
You're gonna introduce me
to people I wouldn't normally meet?

89
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,025
What is that supposed to mean?

90
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,027
- Settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

91
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,411
We're able to sit here because
you used to sleep with the door guy.

92
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,951
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

93
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:08,414
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

94
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,083
What part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

95
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,461
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

96
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,837
- Is this real?
- Yes.

97
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,922
- Wait. I apologize.
- I have to go study.

98
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,382
- Erica?
- Yes?

99
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,634
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate that, but I have to study.

100
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,970
You don't have to study. Let's just talk.

101
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,347
- I can't.
- Why?

102
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,308
It is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

103
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,894
All I meant is that
you're not likely to currently.

104
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,896
It wasn't about your appearance.
You go to BU.

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,981
I stated a fact.
If it seemed rude, I apologize.

106
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,649
- I have to go study.
- You don't.

107
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,633
- Why are you saying I don't have to study?
- You go to BU.

108
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,449
Want to get some food?

109
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,118
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

110
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.
We're even.

111
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,956
- I think we should be friends.
- I don't want friends.

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,959
I was being polite.
I have no intention of being friends.

113
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,743
I'm under pressure from my OS class.
If we just order some food, I think...

114
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,510
Okay, you are probably going
to be a very successful computer person.

115
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,221
But you're gonna go through life

116
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,932
thinking girls don't like you
because you're a nerd.

117
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,978
I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

118
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,024
It'll be because you're an asshole.

119
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,832
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

120
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,334
<i>Is it because her family
changed their name from Albrecht?</i>

121
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,630
<i>Or do you think
it's because all BU girls are bitches?</i>

122
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,136
<i>For the record, she may look like a 34C,</i>

123
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,722
<i>but she's getting help
from Victoria's Secret.</i>

124
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,725
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.</i>

125
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,143
<i>False advertising.</i>

126
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

127
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,192
<i>I need to do something
to take my mind off her.</i>

128
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,028
<i>Easy enough, except I need an idea.</i>

129
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,203
<i>I'm a little intoxicated,
I'm not gonna lie.</i>

130
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,248
<i>- So what if it's not even 10 p.m. Tuesday?</i>
- Billy.

131
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,167
<i>The Kirkland facebook is open
on my desktop.</i>

132
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,669
<i>Some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

133
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,712
Oh, no.

134
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,298
<i>Billy Olson's had the idea
of putting some pictures</i>

135
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,885
<i>next to pictures of farm animals,
and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

136
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,470
<i>Good call, Mr. Olson.</i>

137
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,896
<i>Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals.</i>

138
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,358
<i>I like the idea of comparing two people.
Gives it a very "Turing" feel.</i>

139
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,903
<i>People's ratings of the pictures will be
more implicit than, say, choosing a number</i>

140
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,864
<i>to represent each person's hotness,
like on HotOrNot.com.</i>

141
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,033
<i>First thing we need is a lot of pictures.</i>

142
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,869
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook.</i>

143
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,103
<i>I have to get all the images
from the houses that people are in.</i>

144
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,375
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

145
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,558
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

146
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,893
<i>They keep everything open</i>

147
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,104
<i>and allow indexes
in their Apache configuration.</i>

148
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,439
<i>So a little Wget magic
is all that's necessary</i>

149
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,274
<i>to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

150
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

151
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,002
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

152
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

153
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,673
<i>I run an empty search,</i>

154
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,050
<i>it returns all images
in the database in a single page.</i>

155
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,345
<i>I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

156
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,929
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

157
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,391
Excuse me, everybody.

158
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,936
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

159
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,064
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

160
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,399
I want to welcome you all

161
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,569
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester.

162
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,286
<i>Lowell has some security.</i>

163
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>They require a user name/password combo.</i>

164
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,749
<i>They don't have access
to the main FAS user database.</i>

165
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,233
<i>They can't detect intrusion.</i>

166
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,377
<i>Adams has no security,</i>

167
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,921
<i>but limits the number of results
to 20 a page.</i>

168
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>I break out the same script
I used on Lowell, and we're set.</i>

169
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,304
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.</i>

170
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

171
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,766
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

172
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,142
<i>There's no public directory.</i>

173
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,352
<i>There's no directory at all.
You do searches.</i>

174
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,855
<i>If a search has more than
20 matches, nothing is returned.</i>

175
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,733
<i>Once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.</i>

176
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,485
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects.</i>

177
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,695
<i>Weird. This may be difficult.
I'll come back later.</i>

178
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,447
- Hey, <i>Shark Week's</i> on.
- What?

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,366
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

180
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,618
<i>Leverett is better.</i>

181
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,953
<i>They make you search,
but you can do an empty search</i>

182
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,455
<i>and get links to every picture.</i>

183
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,999
<i>It's obnoxious that
they only let you view one at a time.</i>

184
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,085
<i>No way I'm going to 500 pages
to download pics one at a time.</i>

185
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>It's necessary to break out Emacs</i>

186
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,605
<i>and modify the Perl script.</i>

187
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,018
Here you go.

188
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,149
<i>Done.</i>

189
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,359
Hey, what's going on?

190
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,863
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here,
and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

191
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,864
Hey, Mark.

192
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,742
- Wardo.
- You and Erica split up.

193
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,276
- How did you know that?
- It's on your blog.

194
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,081
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

195
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:29,998
I need you.

196
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,125
I'm here for you.

197
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,585
I need your algorithm
to rank chess players.

198
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,922
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

199
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,175
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

200
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,177
You think this is such a good idea?

201
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,679
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark.

202
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,473
I need the algorithm.

203
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,268
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

204
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,728
At any given time,
Girl A has a rating R-a,

205
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,939
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

206
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,190
When two girls are matched,

207
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,985
there's an expectation of which will win
based on current rating?

208
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,947
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

209
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,823
Let's write it.

210
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,881
One on the left.

211
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,843
- The right.
- Yeah, still the right.

212
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,720
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

213
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,179
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

214
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,016
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

215
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,434
The question is,

216
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,061
who are they gonna send it to?

217
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,384
Hey, guys, check this out.

218
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,554
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

219
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,639
Look at these girls.

220
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,140
Right or left?

221
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,476
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

222
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,854
Right or left?

223
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,689
That's my roommate.

224
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,191
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

225
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,527
This is pathetic.

226
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,488
- Right.
- Left.

227
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,240
- Left.
- Left?

228
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,617
Oh, shit.

229
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,536
Albright.

230
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
He blogged about you.

231
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,666
You don't wanna read it.

232
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,671
Left.

233
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,506
Oh, Latina.

234
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,716
Erica.

235
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,384
Is this yours?

236
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,552
I stole it from a tranny.

237
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,263
Get the hell out of here.

238
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,432
- Left.
- One on the right.

239
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,809
Left.

240
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,735
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

241
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,490
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

242
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,374
Hello?

243
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,128
Wait, wait, wait. What?

244
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,797
At 4 in the morning?

245
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,925
There's an unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

246
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,511
You're saying,
it's unusual for 4 in the morning?

247
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,765
No, this would be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

248
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,266
All right.

249
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,771
I gotta go in.

250
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,314
What's going on?

251
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,567
Harvard's network is about to crash.

252
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,075
You don't think...

253
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,078
I do.

254
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,081
Go see if it's everybody's.

255
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,255
I can't connect.

256
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,799
The network's down.

257
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,052
Unless it's a coincidence,
I think this is us.

258
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,553
It's not a coincidence.

259
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,556
Holy shit.

260
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,394
You were called in front of the Ad Board.

261
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,604
That's not what happened.

262
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,689
You weren't called
to the Administrative Board?

263
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,734
No, back. I mean,
back at the bar with Erica Albright.

264
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,152
- She said all that?
- Mark...

265
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,155
- That I said that to her?
- I read the transcript of her deposition.

266
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,907
Why would you need to depose her?

267
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,658
That's really for us to decide.

268
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,245
You think if I know she can make me look
like a jerk, I'm more likely to settle.

269
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,665
Can we stretch our legs for a minute?
It's been almost three hours.

270
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,876
Frankly, you did spend
an awful lot of time

271
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,296
embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

272
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,174
- I'm not embarrassed. She made a lot up.
- She was under oath.

273
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,058
I guess that's the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

274
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,315
The site got 2200 hits within two hours?

275
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,900
Thousand.

276
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,818
What?

277
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,613
Twenty-two thousand.

278
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,219
These guys are just freaking fast.

279
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,199
Is there any way
to make this a fair fight?

280
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,229
Jump out and swim.

281
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,898
Think we'd have to jump out and drown.

282
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,068
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

283
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,821
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

284
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,055
Just row the damn boat.

285
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,040
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

286
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,544
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

287
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,671
- Really?
- At 4 a.m.

288
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,589
How?

289
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:14,051
Set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

290
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,469
What were we doing that none of us heard?

291
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,431
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

292
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,891
Full course load. Studying.

293
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,435
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

294
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,769
Not sure how we missed it.

295
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,553
- How much activity was on this thing?
- Twenty-two thousand page requests.

296
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,275
Twenty-two thousand?

297
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,819
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

298
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,614
He set up the whole website
in one night, while he was drunk.

299
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,824
Twenty-two thousand?

300
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,691
- How do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

301
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,187
Know what I think?

302
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,080
Way ahead of you.

303
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,374
This is our guy.

304
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,834
Cameron Winklevoss.

305
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,129
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

306
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,589
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

307
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,049
Tyler Winklevoss.

308
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,594
Tyler spelled the usual way.
My last name is the same as my brother's.

309
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,681
Mr. Zuckerberg,
this is an Administrative Board hearing.

310
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,684
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

311
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
violating copyrights,

312
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,775
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.Facemash.com.

313
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,569
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

314
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,738
on distribution of digitized images.

315
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,824
Before we begin our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

316
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,118
Would you like to do so?

317
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,911
I...

318
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,792
You know, I've already apologized
in <i>The Crimson</i> to the ABHW,

319
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,585
to Fuerza Latina,

320
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,963
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

321
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,506
as I take it that they were.

322
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,385
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

323
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,138
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

324
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,892
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

325
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,435
I don't understand.

326
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,395
Which part?

327
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
You deserve recognition?

328
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,109
I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

329
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,362
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

330
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,783
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

331
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,369
and I can assure you
of its sophistication.

332
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,039
That level of sophistication
led us to you in less than four hours.

333
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,791
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

334
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,168
That'd be impressive,
but if you knew what to look for,

335
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,452
you'd have seen it
written on my dorm window.

336
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:20,927
So?

337
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,930
Six months academic probation.

338
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,682
Wow, well,
they had to make an example out of you.

339
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,892
They had my blog.

340
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,645
I shouldn't have written that thing
about farm animals. That was stupid.

341
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,732
But I was kidding.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

342
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,192
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

343
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,904
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

344
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,781
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

345
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,949
You can't do that.

346
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,451
Wardo, I said, I know.

347
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,578
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

348
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,540
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

349
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,251
and a page size of 256 bytes.

350
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:58,173
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

351
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,592
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.

352
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,926
Who knows?

353
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,221
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

354
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,183
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

355
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,019
The eight status bits would then be...

356
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,979
Anybody?

357
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,191
And I see we have our first surrender.

358
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,567
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

359
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,944
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

360
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,654
One valid bit, one modified bit,

361
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,491
one reference bit,
and five permission bits.

362
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,078
That is correct.

363
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,039
Does everybody see how he got there?

364
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
Mark?

365
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,964
You Mark Zuckerberg?

366
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,257
Yeah.

367
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,385
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

368
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,344
Tyler Winklevoss.

369
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,804
Are you guys related?

370
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:46,805
That's good.

371
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,739
- Funny.
- We never heard that before.

372
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,350
What can I do for you?

373
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,478
- Did I insult your girlfriends?
- No, you didn't. Actually, I don't know.

374
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,313
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

375
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,398
No.

376
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,692
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

377
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,944
You got a minute?

378
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,238
You look like
you spend some time at the gym.

379
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,657
- We have to.
- Why?

380
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,742
We row crew.

381
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,828
Yeah, I've got a minute.

382
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,746
Great.

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,085
- You ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

384
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,963
We can't take you past the bike room,
because you're not a member.

385
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:20,881
I've heard.

386
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,719
You want a sandwich or something?

387
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,137
Okay.

388
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,972
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,391
- This is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

390
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,143
We were really impressed with Facemash.

391
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,478
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

392
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,688
I don't know CourseMatch.

393
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,232
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

394
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,817
It's really smart, man.

395
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,070
- Mark.
- Yeah.

396
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,198
We were talking about CourseMatch.

397
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,117
It was kind of a no-brainer.

398
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,119
You invented something in high school too?

399
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,540
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

400
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,667
Anybody try to buy it?

401
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,252
Microsoft.

402
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,545
Wow, how much?

403
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,672
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

404
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,549
- For free?
- Yeah.

405
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
Why?

406
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,221
We have something
that we've been working on for a while.

407
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,682
We think it's great.
It's called the Harvard Connection.

408
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,144
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

409
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,563
People can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

410
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,941
How's it different
from MySpace or Friendster?

411
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,029
Harvard.ed...

412
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,740
The most prestigious
e-mail address in the country.

413
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,992
Whole site's
based on the idea that girls...

414
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,785
Not to put anything indelicately...

415
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,662
Girls wanna go
with guys who go to Harvard.

416
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,123
Divya and my brother
put things indelicately.

417
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,334
Difference between
what we're talking about

418
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,337
and MySpace, Friendster,
or other social networking sites...

419
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,463
Is exclusivity.

420
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,633
- Right?
- Right.

421
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,510
- Yeah.
- We'd love for you to work with us.

422
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,261
We need a gifted, creative programmer.

423
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,013
And you've been taking it in the shins.

424
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,247
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

425
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,436
But this could help
rehabilitate your image.

426
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,480
Wow, you would do that for me?

427
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,609
We'd like to work with you.

428
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,320
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

429
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,323
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

430
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,368
We need you to build the site,
write the code. We'll provide the...

431
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,620
I'm in.

432
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,289
What?

433
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,291
I'm in.

434
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,917
Awesome.

435
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,502
That's what you said?

436
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,964
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

437
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,967
- When did you come to Eduardo?
- I don't understand that question.

438
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,251
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

439
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,971
The affirmative?

440
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,264
When did you come to Eduardo

441
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,598
with the idea for Facebook?

442
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,809
It was called The Facebook then.

443
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,394
This doesn't need to be difficult.

444
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,980
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

445
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,481
Did you answer affirmatively

446
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,900
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

447
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,652
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

448
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,655
Did you say yes?

449
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,323
I said I'd help.

450
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,368
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

451
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,995
I wouldn't say I approached him.

452
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,289
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

453
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,749
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

454
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,167
What's that?

455
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,878
The Jewish fraternity.

456
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,006
It was Caribbean Night.

457
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,026
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

458
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,195
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

459
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,448
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

460
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,158
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

461
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,286
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart.

462
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,456
They're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

463
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,832
Hey, Mark's here.

464
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,917
Mark.

465
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,672
Be right back.

466
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,555
I came up with something.

467
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,766
I gotta tell you something
that you won't believe.

468
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,850
What?

469
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,769
I got punched by the Phoenix.

470
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,521
- Are you kidding?
- No.

471
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,316
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

472
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,902
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

473
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,779
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

474
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:13,739
So...

475
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,532
You got punched by the Phoenix.

476
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,243
Yeah, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

477
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,871
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

478
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,749
What did you
wanna talk to me about? Mark?

479
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,334
- Yeah.
- You came up with something?

480
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,170
I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

481
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,463
It's 20 degrees outside.

482
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,715
I can't stare
at that loop of Niagara Falls,

483
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,449
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

484
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,148
- People came to Facemash in a stampede.
- Yeah.

485
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,025
Not because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

486
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,194
Anywhere on the Internet,
you can see hot girls.

487
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,112
Yeah.

488
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,996
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

489
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,409
People want to go online
and check out friends.

490
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,495
Why not build a website that offers that?
Friends, pictures, profiles.

491
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,040
Whatever you can visit. Browse around.
Maybe someone you met at a party.

492
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,418
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

493
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,714
I'm talking about taking
the entire social experience of college

494
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,173
and putting it online.

495
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,466
I can't feel my legs.

496
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,677
I know.
I'm totally psyched about this too.

497
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,220
- But, Wardo?
- Yeah?

498
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,764
"It would be exclusive."

499
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,600
You have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

500
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,520
Like getting punched.

501
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,438
Now, that's good.

502
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,648
It's like a final club,
except we're the president.

503
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,151
I told him, I thought it sounded great.

504
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,196
It was a great idea.
There was nothing to hack.

505
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,408
People would provide
their own pictures, their own information.

506
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,830
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

507
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,000
See, in a world
where social structure was everything,

508
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,169
that was the thing.

509
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,129
It was a big project,

510
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,382
and he would have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code.

511
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,217
I wondered why he was coming to me,

512
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,595
not his roommates,
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.

513
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,804
They were programmers.

514
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,767
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

515
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,560
So that was why.

516
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,228
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

517
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,355
We'll split it, 70/30.

518
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,900
Seventy for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1000

519
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,818
and handling everything
on the business end.

520
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,361
- You're CFO.
<i>- And you said?</i>

521
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,071
I said, "Let's do it."

522
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,074
Okay. Did he add anything else?

523
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,534
Yes.

524
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,039
It probably was a diversity thing.

525
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,209
But so what?

526
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,670
- Why do you think he said that?
- Gretchen, whose discovery is this?

527
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,340
- Sy, let me continue my questioning.
- What are you suggesting?

528
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,717
That I was jealous
Eduardo got punched by the Phoenix,

529
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,845
and began a plan to screw him
out of a company I hadn't invented yet.

530
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,263
- Were you?
- Gretchen.

531
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,640
- Jealous of him?
- Stop typing.

532
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,683
- Off the record.
- You did your homework.

533
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,560
You know money
isn't a big part of my life.

534
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,771
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

535
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,705
take the Phoenix Club,
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

536
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,655
I'll let you know how the party is.

537
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,831
<i>We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

538
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,374
and a witness in another.

539
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,500
Yes, sir.

540
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,670
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

541
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,214
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

542
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,591
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

543
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,302
Yes, he said,
they'd asked him to work on their site,

544
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:27,348
but that he looked at what they had,
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

545
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,100
He said, even his most pathetic friends

546
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,103
knew more about
getting people interested in a website

547
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,020
than these guys.

548
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,189
"These guys," meaning my clients.

549
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,440
Yes. He resented...

550
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,943
Mark resented that your clients thought

551
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,487
that he needed
to rehabilitate his image after Facemash.

552
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,656
Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything.

553
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,576
With Facemash,
he'd hacked into the Harvard computers,

554
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,662
thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
gotten a lot of notoriety.

555
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

556
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,542
Were you aware that
while Mr. Zuckerberg built The Facebook,

557
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,502
he was communicating with the plaintiffs?

558
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,588
Not at the time, I wasn't, but...

559
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,384
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

560
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,720
- How do you know? You weren't even there.
- Ty.

561
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,637
Were you aware

562
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,307
that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

563
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,602
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

564
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,186
A conclusion not found in evidence.

565
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,564
We are about to find it in evidence.

566
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,067

570

So we can talk about it after
I get all the basic functionality up,

tomorrow night."

572
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,792
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Cameron Winklevoss, December 1st, 2003.

573
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,254
<i>"Sorry I was unreachable tonight.
I just got three of your missed calls.</i>

<i>"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,</i>

578
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,268
<i>so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."</i>

579
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,562
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

580
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,524
Anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

581
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,862
Tell him okay, but we do have to
meet up before we all go off for break.

582
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,446
I know, I know.

583
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
Yeah, watch out.

584
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,397
Hey, Mark.

585
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,525
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

586
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,026
Gonna cost a little more money.

587
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,362
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

588
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,907
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

589
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,079
- Do it.
- I already did.

590
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,584
Hey, guess what?

591
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,879
I made the second cut.

592
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,938
That's good. You should be proud of that.
Don't worry if you don't make it further.

593
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,849
I'll get out of here.

594
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,268
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg

595

so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

599
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,322
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

600
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,575
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

601
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,745
I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I"

602
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:40,458
"won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

603
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,966
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

604
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,427
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

605
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,930
What are the three lies?

606
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,307
Mr. Dowd.

607
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,726
The three lies. First...

608
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,643
Shit.

609
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,728
Take your pants off.

610
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,646
I know.

611
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,065
Mr. Saverin.

612
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,777
One, Harvard was founded
in 1636, not 1638.

613
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,112
Two, Harvard was
not founded by John Harvard.

614
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,739
Three, that is not John Harvard.

615
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,032
Who is it?

616
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,451
It's a friend of the sculptor,

617
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,620
Daniel Chester.

618
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,413
Keep your jacket on.

619
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,962
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

620
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,257

on Harvard Connection.

621

<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

622
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,264
<i>Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook</i>

623
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,143
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

624
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,064
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

625
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,818
Not to my knowledge. No.

626
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,032
What in the world is this?

627
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,784
"Hey, Cameron,

628
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,037
I'm still a little skeptical that
we have enough functionality in the site

00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,539
to really draw the attention

630
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:05,043
and gain the critical mass necessary
to get a site like this to run.

631

We'll speak soon"?

632
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,341
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

633
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,300
Yes, it was.

634
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,972
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return.

635
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,724
This was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

636
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,725
That's correct.

637
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,687
He had 42 days
to study our system and get out ahead.

638
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,647
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?

639
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,274
- Sy, could you?
- Did I use your code?

640
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,192
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

641
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,152
Fellas.

642
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,696
- Match.com for Harvard guys?
- Can I continue my deposition?

643
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,949
You don't need a forensics team
to get to the bottom of this.

644
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,160
If you guys were
the inventors of Facebook,

645
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,454
you'd have invented Facebook.

646
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,374
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
as you write us a check.

647
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,793
No shit.

648
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,754
Let's continue.

649
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,300
February 4, 2004.

650
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,513
Mark.

651
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,681
Mark.

652
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,518
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

653
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,802
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

654
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,149
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

655
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,613
And if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

656
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,531
Dustin.

657
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,286
People don't walk around
with a sign on them that says...

658
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,208
Mark?

659
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,112
We were supposed to meet at 9.
Have you slept yet?

660
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,406
I have to add something.

661
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,283
What?

662
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,796
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

663
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,047
It's clean and simple.

664
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,800
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

665
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,386
What'd you write?

666
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,056
"Relationship status. Interested in."

667
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,184
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

668
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,521
It's why people take certain classes,
sit where they sit, and do what they do.

669
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,231
And at its center, you know,

670
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,441
that's what
The Facebook is gonna be about.

671
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,778
People will log on because
there's a chance they're actually...

672
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,821
Gonna get laid.

673
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,114
Meet a girl. Yes.

674
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,950
- That is really good.
- And that was it.

675
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,576
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

676
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,860
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah, that was it.

677
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,998
And here's the masthead.

678
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,457
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

679
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,877
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

680
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,046
You have no idea what
that will mean to my father.

681
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,131
Sure I do.

682
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,260
So when's it going live?

683
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,972
Right now. Get your laptop out.

684
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,599
What? Why do we need my laptop?

685
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,894
You got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

686
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,944
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

687
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,739
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

688
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,533
If we send it to our friends,
it'll just bounce around Dworkin.

689
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,076
I haven't gotten in yet.

690
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,579
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

691
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,416
- Sure.
- Good.

692
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,043
Give me the mailing list.

693
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,587
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

694
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,629
These guys.

695
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,924
They're literary geniuses because an
obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in...

696
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,676
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

697
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,719
Yeah, you're right.

698
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,937
The site's live.

699
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,190
You know,
let's go get a drink and celebrate.

700
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,484
I'm buying.

701
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,320
Mark.

702
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,741
Mark, are you praying?

703
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,757
Whatever happened
to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin?

704
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,510
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

705
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,994
Good point. Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

706
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,145
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

707
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,271
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

708
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,689
- KC.
- What is it?

709
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,857
I don't know.

710
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,068
But I hope
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler.

711
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,737
I can never get enough of that.

712
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,698
No, it's not.

713
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,120
Div.

714
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,206
What?

715
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,588
This isn't mine.

716
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,840
Okay, what is wrong?

717
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,678
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

718
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:22,944
Hey.

719
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,487
Hey.

720
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,907
Not now. We need 20 minutes.

721
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,492
Okay.

722
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,621
Just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

723
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,582
Mark Zuckerberg?

724
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,834
He stole our website.

725
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,171
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

726
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,720
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

727
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,055
I'm here with Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

728
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,016
"Welcome to The Facebook,
an online directory

729
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,186
that connects people
through different social networks.

730
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,980
You must have
a harvard.edu address to register."

731
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,524
I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

732
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,985
Yes, he's quoted a couple times.
I can read it to you.

733
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,572
"'Everyone's talking about a universal
facebook within Harvard, ' he says."

734
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,490
"He" meaning Mark.

735
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,826
"'It's silly that it'd take the university
a couple years to get around to it.

736
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,287
I can do a classier job.
I did it in a week.'"

737
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,705
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

738
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,957
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

739
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,168
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

740
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,963
over 650 students had registered
to use TheFacebook.com.

741
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,550
He said he anticipated that 900 students
would've joined the site by this morning."

742
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,012
Divya just read that 650 students
signed up for it on the first day.

743
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,597
God, if I was a drug dealer,

744
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,183
I couldn't give free drugs
to 650 people in one day.

745
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,895
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

746
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,398
Yes, Mr. Hotchkiss, we'll put
all this together and e-mail it to you.

747
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,109
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

748
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,403
Because you don't have a Harvard...

749
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,323
It would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

750
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,075
I'm sure you're right. He's a good guy.

751
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,661
He's very bright.
I'm sure he didn't mean to do

752
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,622
what he did.

753
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,542
Thank you very much.
And Dad... All right, love you too.

754
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,378
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

755
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,047
He stole our idea,
lied to our faces for a month and a half.

756
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,341
- He never lied to our faces.
- He never saw our faces.

757
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,803
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts,
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

758
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,013
because he knows
what apparently you don't:

759
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,723
Getting there first is everything.

760
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,016
I'm a competitive racer.

761
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,019
You don't need to school me
in the importance of getting there first.

762
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,604
That was your father's lawyer?

763
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,565
His in-house counsel.
He'll look at all this.

764
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,900
If appropriate,
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

765
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,361
- What will that do?
- Wanna hire an IP lawyer and sue him?

766
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,489
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos
to beat the shit out of him with a hammer.

767
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,782
- We don't have to.
- Right.

768
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,035
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

769
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,370
- I'm with this guy.
- Whatever.

770
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,872
Calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

771
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,125
How much more information
are you waiting for?

772
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,668
We met with Mark three times.

773
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,588
We exchanged 52 e-mails.
We can prove that he looked at the code.

774
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,716
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

775
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,302
- On the home page?
- On every page.

776
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,013
I need a second
to let the classiness waft over me.

777
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,514
- We don't know...
- Cam, they wrote:

778
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,641
"Zuckerberg said,
he hoped the privacy options

779
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,227
would help restore his reputation
following student outrage

780
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,021
over Facemash.com."

781
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,905
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in <i>The Crimson.</i>

782
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,444
While we wait for
Dad's lawyer to look this over,

783
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,738
we can get something in the paper,
so people know...

784
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,406
- What?
- That this is in dispute.

785
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,950
We're not starting a knife fight
in <i>The Crimson.</i>

786
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,161
- And we're not suing anybody.
- Why not?

787
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,915
I don't understand. Why not?

788
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,835
He's gonna say it's stupid.

789
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,420
What, who, me?

790
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:28,838
Say it. Why not?

791
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,633
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

792
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,093
This is Harvard,
where you don't plant stories,

793
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,929
and you don't sue people.

794
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,557
You thought he'd be the only one
who thought that's stupid?

795
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,352
During the time
when you say you had this idea,

796
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:47,440
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

797
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,332
- "A family of means"?
- Did you know their father was wealthy?

798
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,862
I'm not sure why you're asking.

799
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,239
It's not important
you be sure why I'm asking.

800
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,200
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

801
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,286
Did you know that they came from money?

802
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,246
I had no idea
if they came from money or not.

803
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,415
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

804
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,752
you referenced
Howard Winklevoss' consulting firm.

805
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,212
If you say so.

806
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,965
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm
with assets in the hundreds of millions.

807
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,259
You also knew
Tyler and Cameron were members

808
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,637
of a Harvard final club
called the Porcellian.

809
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,971
They pointed that out.

810
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,516
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

811
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,061
Please. So it's safe to say,
you were aware that my clients had money.

812
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:28,855
Yes.

813
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,357
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

814
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,902
I'm wondering why, if you needed
$1000 for an Internet venture,

815
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,404
you didn't ask my clients for it.

816
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,115
They had demonstrated
an interest to you in that kind of thing.

817
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,451
I went to my friend for money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

818
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,204
Eduardo was the president
of the Harvard Investors Association.

819
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,706
He was also my best friend.

820
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,794
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

821
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,754
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

822
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,632
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

823
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,926
Would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

824
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,761
- They're best friends.
- Not anymore.

825
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,847
We already went through this on...
Never mind.

826
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,516
Mr. Saverin,
what happened after the initial launch?

827
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,017
It exploded.

828
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,894
Everybody on campus was using it.

829
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,273
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

830
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,150
And Mark?

831
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,735
And Mark was the biggest thing

832
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,154
on a campus
that included 19 Nobel laureates,

833
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,947
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,

834
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,825
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

835
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,368
Who was the movie star?

836
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,078
Does it matter?

837
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:25,996
No.

838
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,544
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of <i>Popular Electronics</i> magazine

839
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,838
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

840
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,257
It was a beautiful day.
I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

841
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,634
He brought that magazine up,
showed it to me, and said,

842
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:43,513
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

843
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,309
And I said,
"Okay. Let's get BASIC out there."

844
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,353
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

845
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,606
The beginnings
of this industry were very humble.

846
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,943
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

847
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,573
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

848
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,744
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

849
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:10,541
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

850
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,793
Your friend.

851
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,253
- Is that Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

852
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,798
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

853
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,217
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

854
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,135
Yeah, we... Yes.

855
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,595
Cool.

856
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,265
- I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.
- Hi.

857
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,809
Well, very nice to meet you.

858
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:32,443
Facebook me when you get home.
Maybe we can all go out and grab a drink.

859
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
Certainly.

860
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,274
Absolutely do that.

861
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,826
She said, "Facebook me,
and we can all go for a drink later,"

862
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,702
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

863
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,246
One, she said, "Facebook me."

864
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,164
- The other...
- They wanna have drinks later.

865
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,083
Yes, have you ever heard
so many good things

866
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,835
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

867
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:55,920
Excuse me, Mark?

868
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,213
Yeah?

869
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,197
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

870
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,592
Sure.

871
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,559
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

872
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,595
Thanks.

873
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,180
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

874
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,765
I could swear he was looking at you

875
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,852
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

876
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,520
I doubt it.

877
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,354
I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

878
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,901
It was Bill Gates.

879
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,154
Shit, that makes sense.

880
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,740
All right. Thanks, guys.

881
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,369
- Are you a moron?
- Are you stupid?

882
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,329
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you?

883
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:35,292
- I wasn't wearing my contacts.
- Can I get a Glock and kill you?

884
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,837
Time to monetize the thing.

885
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,297
What were their names?

886
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,048
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

887
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,093
I said, it's time to monetize the site.

888
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,303
What does that mean?

889
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,264
Means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

890
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,848
I know what the word means.
How do you wanna do it?

891
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,728
- Advertising.
- No.

892
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,105
Well, we got 4000 members.

893
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,440
Because The Facebook is cool.

894
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,151
If we install pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it won't be cool.

895
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,320
I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

896
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,906
talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

897
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,326
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

898
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,745
We don't know
what it can be, what it will be.

899
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,163
We know that it is cool.

900
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,374
- That's a priceless asset I won't give up.
- So when will it be finished?

901
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,544
It won't be finished. That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

902
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,922
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

903
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,632
You're talking about fashion? You?

904
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:26,134
I'm talking about the idea of it.
It's never finished.

905
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,930
Okay, but they manage
to make money selling pants.

906
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,223
Mark, what is this?

907
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,892
- What?
- This.

908
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,311
A cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

909
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,437
- Who?
- The girls.

910
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,647
When did you get this?

911
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,857
Ten days ago. After we launched the site.

912
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,776
- Jesus.
- The girls. What were their names?

913
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,987
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

914
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,448
I find that
a little more than mildly annoying.

915
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,160
Well, they find it
to be intellectual property theft.

916
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,119
- Look.
- Why didn't you show me?

917
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,829
It was addressed to me.

918
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,874
They say we stole The Facebook
from Divya and the Winklevosses.

919
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,585
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

920
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,169
Did we what?

921
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,380
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

922
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,173
It says we could face legal action.

923
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,217
No, it says I could face legal action.

924
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,511
This is from a lawyer.
They feel they have grounds.

925
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,763
The lawyer is
their father's house counsel.

926
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,099
- Do they have grounds?
- Our thing is cool and popular.

927
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,558
Harvard Connection is lame.

928
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,811
I didn't use any of their code, I promise.

929
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,853
I didn't use anything.

930
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,897
A guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

931
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,649
to everyone who ever has built a chair.

932
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,484
They had an idea, I had a better one.

933
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,718
- Why didn't you show me this?
- Didn't think it was a big deal.

934
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,949
Okay.

935
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,576
So if there's something wrong,

936
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,830
if there's ever anything wrong,

937
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:37,914
you can tell me.

938
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,458
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

939
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,921
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

940
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,547
No.

941
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,301
What are we doing about this?

942
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,847
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services.
He told me to write them back.

943
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,140
And what did you say?

944
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,309
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

945
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,854
Where it stood with graphics,
how much programming was left

946
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,272
that I had not anticipated."

947
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,566
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

948
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,902
the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

949
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,573
This was the first time
you raised any of those concerns, right?

950
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,324
I'd raised concerns before.

951
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,659
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

952
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,120
Gentlemen, I'm talking about
at the meeting in January

953
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,913
to which this letter is referring.

954
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:19,831
Yeah.

955
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,542
Let me rephrase this.

956
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,877
You sent my client 16 e-mails.

957
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,588
In the first 15,
you didn't raise any concerns.

958
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,797
Is that a question?

959
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,384
In the 16th e-mail, you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

960
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,262
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

961
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,599
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

962
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,350
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

963
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,977
It just started raining.

964
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,814
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

965
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,774
No.

966
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,277
Do you think I deserve it?

967
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,736
What?

968
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,114
Do you think
I deserve your full attention?

969
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,450
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition.

970
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,453
I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

971
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,373
Okay, no.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

972
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,877
If your clients wanna sit on my shoulders
and call themselves tall,

973
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,045
they have a right to try,

974
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,279
but there's no requirement
that I enjoy listening to people lie.

975
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,666
You have part of my attention.
The minimum amount.

976
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,971
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

977
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,807
where my colleagues and I
are doing things

978
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,559
that no one in this room,
including and especially your clients,

979
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,093
are intellectually
or creatively capable of doing.

980
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,780
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

981
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:38,827
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

982
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,747
Back at 2:30.

983
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,791
So, what were their names?

984
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,004
Their names were Christy and Alice.

985
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,967
And they wanna have drinks tonight.

986
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,514
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

987
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,077
Oh, my God.

988
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,287
I don't care.

989
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,602
Hey, man, sorry.

990
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,730
Couple girls are freshening up in there.

991
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,191
Sweet.

992
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,738
We have groupies.

993
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,040
I'll be right back.

994
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,834
Mark, where you going? Mark.

995
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,299
Erica?

996
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,176
Hi.

997
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,929
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club.

998
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,597
- First time.
- Mine too.

999
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,641
Could I talk to you alone?

1000
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,185
I think I'm good here.

1001
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,272
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone,
if we could just go some place.

1002
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,607
Right here is fine.

1003
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,401
You hear about
this new website I launched?

1004
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,320
No.

1005
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,156
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet.

1006
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,075
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1007
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,244
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1008
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,371
Comparing women to farm animals.

1009
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,789
I didn't end up doing that.

1010
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,499
Didn't stop you from writing it.

1011
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,252
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1012
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,504
it would be a crime
for it not to be shared.

1013
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,716
The Internet's not written in pencil,
it's written in ink,

1014
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,761
and you published that
Erica Albright was a bitch,

1015
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:06,015
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1016
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,602
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1017
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,653
- Is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1018
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,774
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room,

1019
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,319
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1020
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,488
I was nice to you.
Don't torture me for it.

1021
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,532
If we could go somewhere for a minute...

1022
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,077
- I don't wanna be rude to my friends.
- Okay.

1023
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,162
Okay.

1024
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,499
Good luck with your video game.

1025
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,709
Hey, that was great.

1026
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,462
That was the right thing to do.
You apologized, right?

1027
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,424
We have to expand.

1028
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,759
Sure. Mark?

1029
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,846
Is he mad about something?

1030
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,141
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1031
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,018
Dustin, you share the coding work with me.

1032
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,186
Chris, you're in charge
of publicity and outreach.

1033
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,981
Start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper, <i>The Bridge.</i>

1034
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,691
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1035
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,568
Somebody will be a computer science major.

1036
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,112
Say Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programming.

1037
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,531
- Why do you want a story in the BU paper?
- Because I do.

1038
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,242
Here's the arrangement.
Eduardo is CFO, and owns 30 percent.

1039
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,369
Dustin is vice president
and head of programming.

1040
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,580
His 5 percent of the company
will come from my end.

1041
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,998
Chris is director of publicity.

1042
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,501
His compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing. Questions?

1043
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,839
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1044
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

1045
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,675
- Hello.
- Hi.

1046
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,178
- Is there anything we can do?
- No, that's it.

1047
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,639
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1048
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,599
- What?
- Stanford.

1049
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,602
It's time for them
to see this in Palo Alto.

1050
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,817
You don't want any lunch?

1051
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,735
No.

1052
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,987
You're welcome to some salad.

1053
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,114
No, thank you.

1054
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:51,955
This must be hard.

1055
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,583
Who are you?

1056
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,668
Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1057
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,128
I mean, what do you do?

1058
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,255
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1059
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,925
My boss wanted me
to sit in on the deposition phase.

1060
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,844
What are you doing?

1061
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,514
Checking in
to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1062
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,934
Bosnia. They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1063
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:23,027
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1064
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,237
I don't hate anybody.

1065
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,825
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1066
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,411
They are suing me
because for the first time in their lives,

1067
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,345
things didn't work out
how they were supposed to for them.

1068
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,297
He's expanding.

1069
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,967
- What?
- To Yale, Columbia, and Stanford.

1070
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,301
It's in <i>The Crimson</i> tomorrow.

1071
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,219
- Really?
- Yep.

1072
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:52,098
Looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him.

1073
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,934
I want to file for injunctive relief
and take the site down.

1074
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,937
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1075
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,023
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1076
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,276
- And I want him dead.
- I want those things too.

1077
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,112
Why aren't we doing anything?
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1078
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,489
- You're not thinking how it'll look.
- How will it look?

1079
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,533
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes,

1080
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,452
chasing Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1081
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:16,122
Cam, he's violated
Massachusetts state law.

1082
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,584
When he goes to Connecticut, New York,
and California, he'll violate federal law.

1083
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,669
By the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1084
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,379
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1085
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,965
Wait. Yeah.

1086
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,424
There is.

1087
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,514
Harvard Student Handbook.
Every freshman is issued one.

1088
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,798
- In this book it says...
- You can't steal from another student.

1089
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,438
It's what we needed. We'll go to Summers.

1090
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,398
You can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1091
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,525
My brother and I
pay tuition at this school.

1092
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,612
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1093
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,281
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1094
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,265
I want a meeting
with the goddamn president of this school.

1095
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,203
Why Stanford?

1096
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,539
Why do you think?

1097
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,377
I'm sorry.

1098
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,462
I'm late for biochem.

1099
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:06,965
Okay.

1100
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,434
You don't know my name, do you?

1101
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,138
Is it Stanford?

1102
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,765
I should just kick your ass.

1103
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,059
How do you go to a party
and meet someone...?

1104
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,354
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1105
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,649
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1106
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,317
What's my major?

1107
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,944
Trombone.

1108
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:28,903
Really?

1109
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,947
I remember something about a trombone.

1110
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,535
French.

1111
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,119
Your major's French.

1112
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,955
- And yours?
- Mine?

1113
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,249
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1114
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,626
I don't go to school.

1115
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,253
- You're kidding.
- No.

1116
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,964
Well, where did you go to school?

1117
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,550
William Taft Elementary,
for a little while.

1118
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,468
Seriously?

1119
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,387
You're not like 15 years old, are you?

1120
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,139
No.

1121
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,351
- Wait, you're not like 15, are you?
- No.

1122
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:01,895
So, what do you do?

1123
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,189
I'm an entrepreneur.

1124
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,691
You're unemployed.

1125
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:07,817
I wouldn't say that.

1126
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,901
What would you say?

1127
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,236
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1128
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,946
What was your latest preneur?

1129
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,823
Well, I founded an Internet company

1130
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,701
that let folks download
and share music for free.

1131
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,077
Kind of like Napster?

1132
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,704
Exactly like Napster.

1133
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:20,664
What do you mean?

1134
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,748
I founded Napster.

1135
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,875
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1136
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,294
Nice to meet you.

1137
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,212
You're Sean Parker?

1138
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,131
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1139
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,217
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1140
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,136
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1141
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,887
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1142
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,472
You're a zillionaire.

1143
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,557
Not technically.

1144
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,558
What are you?

1145
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,477
Broke. Not a lot of money in free music.

1146
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,856
Even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1147
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,441
This is blowing my mind.

1148
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,442
I appreciate that.

1149
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,611
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1150
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:55,406
Biochem, even though
you're a French major whose name is Amy.

1151
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,741
You passed.

1152
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,076
I'm a hard worker.

1153
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,663
There's juice
or anything else you can find.

1154
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,956
Help yourself.

1155
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,374
Mind if I check my e-mail?

1156
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,334
Yeah, go ahead.

1157
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:17,721
Amy.

1158
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,432
Jesus.

1159
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,643
- Amy, can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1160
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,937
Just a second.

1161
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,650
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1162
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:31,693
What?

1163
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,279
- Where?
- There's no snake.

1164
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,614
I need to ask something.

1165
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,866
Are you kidding me?
I could've been killed.

1166
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,867
How?

1167
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,952
By running too fast,

1168
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,871
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1169
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,706
What do you need to ask me?

1170
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,501
I went to check my e-mail,
and there's a website open.

1171
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:53,547
Yeah, after you passed out last night,
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1172
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,174
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1173
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,469
Stanford's had it for like two weeks now.

1174
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,514
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1175
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,058
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1176
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,643
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1177
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,269
Yeah, is everything okay?

1178
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,688
Everything's great.

1179
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:14,486
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1180
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,740
I've never been in this building before.

1181
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,910
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in,

1182
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,037
so do be careful.

1183
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,040
We're sitting in chairs.

1184
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:28,917
Yes.

1185
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,504
Very good. You can go in now.

1186
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,552
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1187
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,303
Darkness is the absence of light,

1188
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,223
and the stupidity
in that instance was the absence of me.

1189
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,225
Catherine,
I've got students in my office now.

1190
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,728
Students. Undergrads.

1191
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:49,645
I don't know.

1192
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,690
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1193
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,817
All right, bye-bye.

1194
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,569
- Good morning.
- Sir, I'm Cameron Winklevoss.

1195
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,778
This is my brother, Tyler.

1196
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,572
And you're here because...

1197
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:02,616
Either of you can answer.

1198
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,202
- I thought you were reading the letter.
- I've read it.

1199
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,497
We came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection.

1200
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,792
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1201
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,377
I understand.

1202
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,921
And I'm asking
what you want me to do about it.

1203
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,759
Sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1204
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,845
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1205
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,348
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1206
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,476
in their dealings
with members in this community.

1207
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,729
Students are required
to respect public and private ownership.

1208
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,939
Instances of theft,
misappropriation, or...

1209
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,232
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1210
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,068
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1211
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:44,074
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1212
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,452
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1213
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,370
You memorized that instead of doing what?

1214
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:52,166
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully...

1215
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,085
Sir, it's against university rules
to steal from another student.

1216
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,504
You spoke to your House Master?

1217
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,089
Yes, the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board.

1218
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,466
But the Ad Board won't see us.

1219
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,635
You tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1220
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,262
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded
to our e-mails or phone calls

1221
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,514
for the last two weeks.

1222
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,557
He doesn't answer his door at Kirkland.

1223
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,643
The closest I've come
to seeing him face-to-face

1224
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,770
is when I chased him
through Harvard Square.

1225
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,397
- You chased him?
- I saw him, and I know he saw me.

1226
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,399
I went after him, and he disappeared.

1227
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:21,070
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course it's a university issue.

1228
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,280
There's a code of ethics
and an honor code.

1229
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,826
You enter into a code of ethics
with the university, not each other.

1230
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,830
I'm sorry, President Summers.
What you just said makes no sense to me.

1231
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,081
I'm devastated by that.

1232
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,750
My brother means, if Mark Zuckerberg
walked into our dorm room

1233
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,086
and stole our computer,
it's be a university issue.

1234
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,755
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1235
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,923
This isn't petty larceny.

1236
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,509
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1237
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,010
- Millions?
- Yes.

1238
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,179
You're letting
your imagination run away with you.

1239
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,099
Sir, I don't think
you're in a position to make that call.

1240
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:54,395
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1241
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,230
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1242
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,482
is what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1243
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,776
Then I suggest
that you let your imaginations

1244
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,444
run away with you on a new project.

1245
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,072
- You would?
- Everyone at Harvard invents something.

1246
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,324
Harvard undergraduates believe

1247
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,702
that inventing a job
is better than finding a job.

1248
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,664
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1249
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,499
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.

1250
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,001
Please, arrive at the point.

1251
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,253
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1252
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,880
to understand right and wrong.

1253
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,172
You're saying that I don't?

1254
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,258
- Of course not, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1255
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,135
- Really?
- Sir.

1256
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,220
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1257
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,098
Colleagues of their father.

1258
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,101
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1259
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,520
since you're
on the subject of right and wrong.

1260
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,063
This action, this meeting,

1261
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,983
the two of you being here is wrong.

1262
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,318
It's not worthy of Harvard.

1263
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,403
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1264
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,031
You don't get special treatment.

1265
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,491
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1266
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:53,037
- Like a diorama for a science fair?
- If you have a problem with that...

1267
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:56,874
- We never asked for special treatment.
- The courts are always at your disposal.

1268
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,292
Anything else I can do for you?

1269
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,776
- Take the Student Handbook and shove it...
- Ty.

1270
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,006
Thank you for your time, sir.

1271
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,432
Whoops, broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1272
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,770
Eduardo, spring break,
you and Mr. Zuckerberg went to New York.

1273
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,904
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1274
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:24,110
Well, as CFO, I had set up
some meetings with potential advertisers.

1275
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:25,986
Who paid for the trip?

1276
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,239
It was paid for out of the $1000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1277
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:33,160
At this point, your $1000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1278
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,394
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1279
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,832
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1280
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,084
Mark was asleep.

1281
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,543
I was not asleep.

1282
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,920
Can I rephrase my answer?

1283
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,048
I wish he'd been asleep.

1284
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:51,637
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1285
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,555
People who go on The Facebook

1286
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,849
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1287
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,018
Now here's the most impressive statistic.

1288
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,854
Ninety-one percent of people
who try it once come back.

1289
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,815
- If you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1290
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,234
What sound is he making?
Is that like a tsk?

1291
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,572
It wasn't a tsk.

1292
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:10,948
It was...

1293
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,743
Like a glottal stop.

1294
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,454
Almost a gag reflex.

1295
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,248
Guys, what is this?

1296
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,626
There was one more meeting
scheduled for the New York trip.

1297
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,587
Yes, a dinner,
set up through my girlfriend at the time.

1298
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,674
Would you say that
Mark was excited about this meeting?

1299
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,010
Yes. Very.

1300
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,053
- They're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1301
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,097
- Look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1302
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,183
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1303
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,977
- Mark.
- You gonna talk about ads again?

1304
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,937
Unless you're
the Ballet Theater of Hartford,

1305
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,939
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1306
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,232
It isn't a business yet.

1307
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,110
That's tough for me, because my job...

1308
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,028
Never mind.

1309
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,449
He's 25 minutes late.

1310
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:56,285
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1311
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,037
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1312
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,621
He's 25 minutes late.

1313
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,956
I think Wardo's jealous.

1314
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,708
I honestly wasn't jealous.

1315
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,460
I was nervous.

1316
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,170
- Why?
- I didn't know him at all.

1317
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,006
But I had done a search
and I'd asked around.

1318
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,468
And he struck me as kind of a...

1319
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,721
A wild card.

1320
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,638
Why?

1321
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:20,434
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion.

1322
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,187
- He has a reputation with drugs.
- He also founded the companies.

1323
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,522
We don't need him.

1324
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:26,899
He's here.

1325
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,070
No, no, take your time.

1326
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,489
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1327
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,074
Hey.

1328
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,076
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1329
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,953
You must be Eduardo,
and Christy, and Mark.

1330
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,997
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1331
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,999
- You don't have anything in front of you.
- No.

1332
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,959
- Tori.
- We were waiting.

1333
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,128
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1334
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:51,048
The lacquered pork
with that ginger confit. Tuna tartare?

1335
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,966
And lobster claws. That'll get us started.

1336
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,844
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1337
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,679
An appletini.

1338
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,765
Great. Four of those.

1339
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,269
From that point on, it was a Sean-athon.

1340
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,739
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1341
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,585
He took us through
his episode with Napster.

1342
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,920
I didn't wanna spend my 20s

1343
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,755
as a professional defendant.

1344
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,883
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1345
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,176
We tried to sell the company

1346
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,470
to pay the 35 million
they said we owed in royalties,

1347
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,804
but I guess to them,
that was a little like

1348
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,475
selling a stolen car
to pay for the stolen gas.

1349
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,727
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1350
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,229
But you made a name for yourself.

1351
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,647
And you are dry.

1352
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,524
- Tori.
- No, no, I'm good.

1353
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,734
Then he went on
to his second business venture,

1354
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,488
which was an online Rolodex
that he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1355
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,450
And I wanted to do it nice this time.
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes.

1356
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,494
But nobody wants
to take orders from a kid.

1357
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,664
Let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1358
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,917
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we got that on the record.

1359
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,211
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1360
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:14,256
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1361
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,009
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1362
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,886
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1363
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,388
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1364
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,099
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1365
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,768
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

1366
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:29,771
And if somehow you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1367
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:30,939
they'll make shit up.

1368
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,525
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1369
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,809
They want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1370
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,530
Excuse me... Wipe your chin and walk away.

1371
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,617
- That's what happened to you?
- And delusional.

1372
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:42,618
Yes.

1373
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,578
But there'll be payback at Case.

1374
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:48,040
I brought down the record companies
with Napster. Case will suffer too.

1375
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,752
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies. They won.

1376
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,879
- In court.
- Yeah.

1377
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,716
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1378
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,679
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1379
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:06,683
and parties at Stanford, and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires.

1380
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:09,353
But mostly how Mark had to...

1381
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:12,023
He had to come to California.

1382
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,025
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1383
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,611
So tell me about your progress.

1384
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,240
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1385
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,325
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1386
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,160
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1387
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,329
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus,

1388
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,997
so instead of going right after them,

1389
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,958
we made a list
of every school in 100 miles.

1390
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,292
Put The Facebook there first.

1391
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:35,045
The Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1392
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,296
The Little Bighorn. Smart.

1393
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,923
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1394
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,758
You know what? Settle an argument for us.

1395
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,927
I say we start making money
from The Facebook.

1396
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,804
Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1397
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,889
Well...

1398
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:49,559
Neither of you yet. The Facebook is cool.
That's what it's got going for it.

1399
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,645
- Yeah.
- You don't wanna ruin it with ads.

1400
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,063
- Ads aren't cool.
- Exactly.

1401
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:56,650
Like you're throwing the greatest party,
and someone says it's gotta be over by 11.

1402
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:57,734
That's exactly right.

1403
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,903
- You don't know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1404
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,030
How big it can get, how far it can go.

1405
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:05,033
This is no time to take your chips down.
A million dollars isn't cool.

1406
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,567
- You know what's cool?
- You?

1407
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,873
"A billion dollars."

1408
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,086
And that shut everybody up.

1409
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,382
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1410
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,050
Unless you take bad advice, in which case

1411
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,137
you may as well have come up with
a chain of successful yogurt shops.

1412
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,890
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1413
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,352
Ever walk into a guy's den
and see a picture of him next to 14 trout?

1414
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,187
- No, he has a 3000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1415
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,397
- Good analogy.
- Okay.

1416
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,858
We all know marlins
don't really weigh 3000 pounds.

1417
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:38,942
Have you seen big ones?

1418
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,945
No, but I don't think he's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1419
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,740
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1420
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,325
We're getting away from the point.

1421
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:50,704
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1422
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,540
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1423
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,959
<i>He picked up the check,
told Mark they'd talk again soon,</i>

1424
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,085
<i>and he was gone.</i>

1425
01:10:57,169 --> 01:11:01,006
But not before he made
his biggest contribution to the company.

1426
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,676
Drop the "The."

1427
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,428
Just "Facebook."

1428
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,430
It's cleaner.

1429
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,934
Shit.

1430
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,688
Goodbye, sweetie.

1431
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:17,690
Yeah.

1432
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,780
That's gotta be some kind
of land speed record for talking.

1433
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,032
You wanna end the party at 11.

1434
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,833
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1435
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,539
So, what do you think?

1436
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,665
Sure, let's drop the "The."

1437
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,794
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1438
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,170
Doesn't that sound good?

1439
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,380
If you're a trout.

1440
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,632
I'll enter this into the record.

1441
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:47,636
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1442
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,805
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1443
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,808
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1444
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:56,269
state the ownership as follows:
65 percent for Mark Zuckerberg,

1445
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,606
30 percent for Eduardo Saverin
and 5 percent for Dustin Moskovitz.

1446
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,774
Yeah, we stipulate.

1447
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,652
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1448
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,362
You have anything here?

1449
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,780
Yes. Thank you.

1450
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,449
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1451
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:12,703
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1452
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:14,955
No.

1453
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,998
You never did anything
to embarrass the company

1454
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,752
or even seriously jeopardize it?

1455
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,587
- No.
- No?

1456
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:26,299
No.

1457
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:28,469
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1458
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,597
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1459
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,975
This is not happening.

1460
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,352
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1461
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,520
Jesus Christ.

1462
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,272
- I can't have this.
- Come on, man.

1463
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,526
This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1464
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,821
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.
I'd been accepted.

1465
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,532
And as part of my initiation,
I had to, for one week,

1466
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,785
carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1467
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,621
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1468
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,039
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1469
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:01,418
I'm no expert, but being connected
to torturing animals is bad for business.

1470
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:06,423
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1471
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:10,302
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1472
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,220
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1473
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,015
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1474
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,892
and I had the chicken with me.

1475
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:19,144
I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1476
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,103
This was college.

1477
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,814
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1478
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,233
The dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1479
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,402
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1480
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,656
I took little pieces of chicken,
and I gave it to the chicken.

1481
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,365
Someone must have seen me.

1482
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:35,660
Next thing I knew,
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1483
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,079
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1484
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,624
I dealt with
the various animal rights groups.

1485
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,876
I dealt with
the associate dean of the college.

1486
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,795
- This was all resolved.
- 988.

1487
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:48,131
Someone from the Porc
or the Fly must've reported it.

1488
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,091
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1489
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,801
All right, just forget about it.

1490
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,846
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1491
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,141
- It's better to be accused of necrophilia.
- It is better.

1492
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:01,645
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I have to explain this to everybody.

1493
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,355
What is happening on that?

1494
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,691
I have my final for Contemporary Art.
I haven't been to class.

1495
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,653
- I have to write about four paintings.
- That's a Facebook page?

1496
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:12,614
I opened it under an alias,
posted the paintings, asked for comments.

1497
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,450
Once in a while,
I stir the pot to get debate going.

1498
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,911
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1499
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:20,747
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1500
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,625
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1501
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,085
That's not what friends do.

1502
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,819
You just told us he was cheating.

1503
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,093
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1504
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,844
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1505
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:37,681
Our litigators are capable
of finding a <i>Crimson</i> article.

1506
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:40,434
When we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1507
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,357
Nine ninety-three. We are so close.

1508
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,485
Oh, yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1509
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,404
Yeah, no, I agree.
More servers, more help.

1510
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,573
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto.

1511
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,533
- We have to pay them something.
- What?

1512
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,160
I found a house for rent
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1513
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,579
It is perfect. It's got a pool.

1514
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,789
When did you decide
to go to California for summer?

1515
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,040
When did I actually decide?

1516
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,752
Was it in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1517
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,005
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1518
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,423
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1519
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,425
You got <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i> in Brazil?

1520
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,677
Yeah, got the show in Brazil.
It was genius.

1521
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,805
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1522
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,099
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1523
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,561
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1524
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,521
- I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1525
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,149
And as somebody who's
just really embarrassed the company...

1526
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,568
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1527
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:32,653
Hit "refresh."

1528
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:36,948
One hundred fifty thousand and four.

1529
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,200
One hundred fifty thousand members, Wardo.

1530
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:41,084
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1531
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:43,371
You don't think it was strange

1532
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,749
that he was followed
by private detectives?

1533
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,543
- Who came up with nothing.
- Enough to get him out of the company.

1534
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,754
- Drugs, girls.
- We don't know that's true.

1535
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,214
- You read about it.
- I read about you torturing birds.

1536
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:56,927
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1537
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:00,513
What's he talking about?

1538
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:03,308
I'm interviewing interns
at 10 tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1539
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,559
Get on board with this.

1540
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,104
You know,
I don't really know what else to say.

1541
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,170
You can do one more.

1542
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,172
One more.

1543
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,220
- Wardo.
- Yo, Mark.

1544
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:43,056
What's going on?

1545
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,558
They have 10 minutes
to access a Python web server,

1546
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:48,728
expose its SSL encryption,
and intercept all traffic over its port.

1547
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:49,646
They're hacking.

1548
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,232
Yes, behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1549
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,317
- I didn't understand anything you said.
- I know.

1550
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,235
What's the beauty?

1551
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,195
Every tenth line of code,
they drink a shot.

1552
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,989
Hacking's stealth, so every time
the server detects an intrusion,

1553
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:01,991
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1554
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,785
I ran a program that has a pop-up window

1555
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,704
appear simultaneously
on all five computers.

1556
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,872
The last to hit the window drinks a shot.

1557
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,958
Plus every three minutes
they all drink a shot.

1558
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,442
- Three minutes.
- Drink now.

1559
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:13,503
Hey, can I ask,

1560
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,673
what part of the intern's job
will they need to do drunk?

1561
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:20,677
You're right, a more relevant test might
be keeping a chicken alive for a week.

1562
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:23,513
That was mean.

1563
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:25,724
- Here.
- What is this?

1564
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,560
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1565
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,980
Will that get you through the summer?

1566
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,189
- Done.
- Mark?

1567
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,650
Right here.

1568
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,073
Welcome to Facebook.

1569
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:52,959
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1570
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,378
In addition to the $1000
you'd already put up.

1571
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,089
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1572
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,258
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1573
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,927
I'm checking your math on that.

1574
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:06,014
Yes, I got the same thing.

1575
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:06,932
May I continue?

1576
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,685
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1577
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,604
and moving it
to California for the summer,

1578
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,774
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1579
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,611
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1580
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,697
I figured Mark, Dustin,
and the new interns could work on the site

1581
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:25,492
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1582
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:26,910
But mostly I figured,

1583
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:30,414
how much could possibly go wrong
in three months?

1584
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,916
Go, go, go.

1585
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:39,714
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1586
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,049
- I made it.
- You did.

1587
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:44,469
Okay, ready?

1588
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,846
- That was like an eight.
- That was like a two.

1589
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,891
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1590
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,484
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

1591
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,443
Yeah.

1592
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:01,737
Yikes.

1593
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,157
- That's the doorbell.
- I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1594
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,391
- Andrew, get the door.
- No, he's wired in.

1595
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,061
That's gonna cut
into your security deposit.

1596
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,082
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1597
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,292
Good boy.

1598
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:20,505
- Sean?
- Mark?

1599
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,758
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1600
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:24,843
- Do you?
- Across the street.

1601
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,261
- We saw the chimney.
- Yeah.

1602
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,895
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1603
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,266
I'm Sharon.

1604
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,434
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1605
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:34,519
I was helping move out.

1606
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,253
- We saw the chimney.
- We had a zip line to the pool.

1607
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:40,400
You came to California.

1608
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,779
- Yeah.
- You made the right choice.

1609
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,536
Here you go.

1610
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,667
Sharon?

1611
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:00,753
- Sorry. I didn't know...
- No problem.

1612
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,172
- Here you go.
- No, wait.

1613
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:08,929
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1614
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,055
I'm Sean Parker.

1615
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,265
Oh, he's wired in.

1616
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:14,351
That's what I'm talking about.

1617
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,228
Where's Eduardo?

1618
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,773
He got an internship in New York.

1619
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:21,775
Eduardo didn't come out?

1620
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,256
I was crashing there for a bit
while I take care of some things,

1621
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,676
but she's done for the summer,
so she's back at her parents' place.

1622
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,430
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1623
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,141
What's your plan for the summer?

1624
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:57,185
Mark?

1625
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,153
Sorry, I was looking at the architecture.

1626
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,649
I asked what your plan...

1627
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,692
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1628
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,402
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1629
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,362
I'll go with you.

1630
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,326
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1631
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:16,360
- She looks familiar to a lot of people.
- What do you mean?

1632
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,668
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife lingerie,

1633
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:24,837
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1634
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,798
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1635
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,008
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1636
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:33,262
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1637
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:36,182
opens a store,
and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1638
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,935
Makes a half million dollars
his first year.

1639
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,188
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years,

1640
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:46,317
he sells the company to Leslie Wexner
and The Limited for $4 million.

1641
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,486
Happy ending, right?

1642
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:52,407
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1643
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:55,660
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1644
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:01,625
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1645
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,211
Was that a parable?

1646
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:08,862
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1647
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,925
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1648
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,135
I read your blog.

1649
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,303
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1650
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:15,972
You know why I started Napster?

1651
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:20,143
The girl I loved in high school was
with the co-captain

1652
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:24,022
of the varsity lacrosse team,
and I wanted to take her from him.

1653
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,107
So I decided
to come up with the next big thing.

1654
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:29,193
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1655
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,613
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1656
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:37,160
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1657
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,662
And isn't that
what your Facemash was about?

1658
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:42,665
They're scared of me, pal.
They're gonna be scared of you.

1659
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,167
What the VCs want is to say,

1660
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,045
"Good idea, kid.
The grown-ups will take it from here."

1661
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:50,214
But not this time. This is our time.

1662
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,718
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1663
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,762
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1664
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:58,098
That's what I want for you.

1665
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,851
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1666
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,520
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1667
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,481
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1668
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,570
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1669
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,322
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1670
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,531
I know you do.

1671
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:18,701
Wardo wants to be a businessman.
For all I know, he's gonna be a good one.

1672
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:21,955
But he shouldn't be in New York,
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1673
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:27,001
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1674
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:31,131
And the water
under the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1675
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,508
Look at my face,

1676
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,969
and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1677
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,722
Do you ever think about that girl?

1678
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:40,807
What girl?

1679
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:44,394
The girl from high school
who was with the lacrosse thing.

1680
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:46,646
No.

1681
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:50,316
If you guys are gonna talk
about bandwidth, we need shots.

1682
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,027
- A hundred schools by the end of summer?
- Yeah.

1683
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,695
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1684
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:58,533
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1685
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,119
Two...

1686
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,461
If you don't have a place to crash,
you should come and live with us.

1687
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,505
Let's line up some shots.

1688
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:13,673
Excuse me.

1689
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:14,590
Yes, sir.

1690
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:17,927
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1691
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,888
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1692
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,322
Attention.

1693
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,366
Go.

1694
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,011
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

1695
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:11,564
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1696
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:14,609
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.</i>

1697
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:28,957
Come on.

1698
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:08,872
Whatever.

1699
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:15,962
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1700
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,838
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1701
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,549
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1702
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:23,094
Sir? His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1703
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,012
Your Highness,
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1704
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:28,349
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1705
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:29,392
Yes, Your Highness.

1706
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,645
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1707
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:36,065
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years.
I'd never seen a race that close.

1708
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,276
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1709
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,318
No, Your Highness.

1710
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:42,280
Mile-and-a-half races are
more commonly won by a boat length or two.

1711
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,532
Yes, that's absolutely right.
Brutally close.

1712
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,908
May I introduce my teammates?

1713
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,286
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1714
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,454
On to the Dutch.

1715
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,625
Sorry you flew out here to see that.

1716
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,961
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1717
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,380
I wanted him
to tell me how close the race was.

1718
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:03,175
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1719
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:05,970
He's prince of a country
the size of Nantucket. Relax, it's fine.

1720
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,221
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1721
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,432
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1722
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,600
I'm sorry that
you and Mom flew here to see that.

1723
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,978
No, never apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1724
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,480
Never apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1725
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:19,108
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1726
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,944
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1727
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,738
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1728
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,740
I had a phone chat with my daughter.

1729
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:28,200
She and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1730
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:30,661
which they've just seen
via their computers.

1731
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,747
A new website called Facebook.

1732
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,374
Do you have this in America?

1733
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,335
I'm gonna find your mother.

1734
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:42,673
- I say something wrong?
- She doesn't go to school in the States?

1735
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:46,844
No, Cambridge. Major in French literature.
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1736
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,304
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

1737
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,306
And Oxford
and the London School of Economics,

1738
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,490
where her friends are.

1739
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,101
That's awesome.

1740
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:57,188
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1741
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,232
I'm gonna watch the race film.

1742
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,822
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1743
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:07,740
Stop it.

1744
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:09,576
Stop it, Cam.

1745
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:11,661
Knock it off.

1746
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:15,331
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1747
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,541
That was a good race.
That was a fair race.

1748
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,085
And they'll see us again.

1749
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,462
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1750
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,924
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1751
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:28,511
We tried talking to him ourselves,
writing a letter, the Ad Board,

1752
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,930
and talking
to the president of the university.

1753
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,349
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1754
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,060
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal

1755
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,646
and sue him in federal court.

1756
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,231
Come on.

1757
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:42,817
I need a real drink.

1758
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,409
Screw it.

1759
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,621
Let's gut the fucking nerd.

1760
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,291
That's what I'm talking about.

1761
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,544
No, no, no...

1762
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,796
But check it out, I saw him today.

1763
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,340
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1764
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:09,260
Hang on. Are you guys
using Spikes or Ghost Missiles?

1765
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,053
We're just shooting at each other.

1766
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,596
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1767
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,182
Like we know what that is.

1768
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:18,978
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera,
and he saw me too.

1769
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:20,021
I know he did.

1770
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,401
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1771
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,112
Bong hit.

1772
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,572
Does anybody hear that banging?

1773
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,856
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1774
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:33,743
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1775
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,537
It's not a dish best served cold.

1776
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,873
It's best served immediately
and relentlessly.

1777
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,420
I'm gonna call you back.

1778
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:47,465
What's up?

1779
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,383
What's up?

1780
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:54,472
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport. I've been calling him.

1781
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:58,142
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1782
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,066
What happened here?

1783
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,569
Not happened. Happening.

1784
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,696
- The next big thing.
- Hey, Wardo.

1785
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,989
Hey, man.

1786
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,200
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1787
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:16,744
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1788
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,373
- I mean, the more wasted that I get...
- We understand.

1789
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,025
How old are they, Sean?

1790
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:25,836
It's not polite to ask.

1791
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,070
Sean, how old are they?

1792
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:29,715
You think you know me, right?

1793
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,133
I've read enough.

1794
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:32,927
Know how much I've read about you?

1795
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:35,597
Nothing.

1796
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:40,976
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1797
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:43,979
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1798
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:46,816
Midnight, or 3 a.m. in New York,
where I just came from.

1799
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,693
You gotta see the new stuff we got.

1800
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,279
Dustin, show him the Wall.
I'm calling it the Wall.

1801
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:55,032
Forget the Wall.
Tell him about the meeting I set up.

1802
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,659
You know Peter Thiel?

1803
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:57,952
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1804
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,539
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1805
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:05,376
- He set up meetings?
- Thiel might make an angel investment.

1806
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,420
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up meetings?

1807
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:09,755
You've had a long flight.

1808
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:11,632
No, I had a long wait
on the tarmac at JFK,

1809
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,051
then a long wait
at the passenger unloading zone at SFO,

1810
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,970
and in between there was a long flight.

1811
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,930
I'm the business end of this company.

1812
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,932
And he is a house guest,

1813
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,351
living here rent-free
on a very generous grant

1814
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:23,978
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1815
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:27,398
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1816
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,108
- Hey.
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1817
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:32,142
You're a step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I feel it.

1818
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:43,987
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1819
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:47,001
Wait, which one am I?

1820
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,503
Bong hit.

1821
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,673
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1822
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,633
So how's it going?

1823
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,427
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1824
01:31:58,262 --> 01:31:59,805
How's the internship?

1825
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:00,723
Yeah.

1826
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,143
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1827
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:07,105
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1828
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:09,857
I do remember you saying that.

1829
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:12,026
So how is Christy?

1830
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,070
Christy's crazy.

1831
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:15,696
Is that fun?

1832
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,740
No. I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1833
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:22,954
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1834
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,665
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1835
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:32,671
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1836
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:34,882
You gotta move here.
It's where it's all happening.

1837
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,051
- Hear what I said?
- Connections, energy...

1838
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:37,968
Mark, you got...

1839
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:40,721
I'm afraid if you don't come,
you'll get left behind.

1840
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,350
I want... I need you out here.
Please, don't tell him I said that.

1841
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:47,436
- What did you say?
- It's moving faster than we ever imagined.

1842
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,064
- What did you mean?
- It's moving fast. Sean thinks we have...

1843
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:52,524
- He's not part of this company.
- We have 300,000 members.

1844
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,486
- I'm aware of that.
- We're in 160 schools, five in Europe.

1845
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,738
- I'm the CFO.
- We need more servers than I expected.

1846
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,490
We need more programmers and more money.

1847
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:02,159
He set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1848
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,577
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1849
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,371
- Without me knowing.
- You're in New York.

1850
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,082
I'm in New York,
riding subways 14 hours a day.

1851
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:10,816
- Trying to find advertisers.
- How's it going so far?

1852
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,175
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1853
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:23,889
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1854
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,516
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1855
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,478
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1856
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:32,523
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure.

1857
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,573
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1858
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:42,658
No problem.

1859
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,246
This is where
they filmed <i>Towering Inferno.</i>

1860
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,456
That's comforting.

1861
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,043
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1862
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,261
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1863
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,799
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1864
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,134
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1865
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:06,014
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1866
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:09,935
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1867
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:13,689
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1868
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,774
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware,

1869
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:18,858
come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1870
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:20,780
Now, let me ask you something.

1871
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,074
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1872
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:44,846
Jesus Christ.

1873
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:51,059
- When did you get back?
- You scared me. I need you to knock.

1874
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:53,020
When did you get back?

1875
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,856
I got back this afternoon.

1876
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,357
When were you gonna call me?

1877
01:34:57,441 --> 01:35:00,360
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip,
and I was tired...

1878
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:02,279
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.

1879
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,198
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1880
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:08,035
I did, and I thought
that was incredibly normal behavior.

1881
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,536
Are you mocking me?

1882
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,163
I brought you a present.

1883
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:15,876
Why does your status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1884
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,044
What?

1885
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:21,048
Why does your relationship status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1886
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,758
I was single when I set up the page.

1887
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:24,927
And you just never bothered to change it?

1888
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:27,263
- What?
- I don't know how.

1889
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,848
Do I look stupid to you?

1890
01:35:29,932 --> 01:35:31,099
No, calm down.

1891
01:35:31,183 --> 01:35:33,310
You're asking me
to believe the CFO of Facebook

1892
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:36,021
doesn't know how to change
his relationship status on Facebook?

1893
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:39,233
It's embarrassing, so take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you.

1894
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,651
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1895
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,944
No, you didn't change it

1896
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:44,947
so you could screw Silicon Valley sluts
every time you go see Mark.

1897
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:48,075
Not even remotely true,
and I promise, the Silicon Valley sluts

1898
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:51,161
don't care what anyone's
relationship status is on Facebook.

1899
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,579
Please, open your present.

1900
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:54,123
Your phone does work.

1901
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,625
It's Mark.

1902
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,377
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1903
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,630
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1904
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,215
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1905
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:04,800
This'll be your first.

1906
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:06,677
Yeah.

1907
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,095
<i>- You froze our account?</i>
- I did.

1908
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,305
- You froze the account.
- To get your attention.

1909
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:12,140
You jeopardized the entire company.

1910
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:14,935
Your actions could've destroyed
everything I've been working on.

1911
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,771
- We have been working on.
- Without money, the site can't function.

1912
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,982
The difference between Facebook
and everybody else,

1913
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,233
we don't crash ever.

1914
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:24,903
If the servers are down for even a day,
our reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1915
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:27,030
- Look.
<i>- Users are fickle. Friendster proved that.</i>

1916
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,867
<i>Even a few people leaving
would reverberate through the user base.</i>

1917
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:32,327
The users are interconnected.
That is the point.

1918
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:34,788
College kids are online
because their friends are online.

1919
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,915
If one domino goes,
the other dominoes go. Get it?

1920
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:39,599
I am not going back
to the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi.

1921
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:42,880
Holy shit.

1922
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:46,800
What is wrong with you?

1923
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:49,094
Did you like being nobody?
Did you like being a joke?

1924
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,220
Wanna go back to that?

1925
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,722
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1926
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,349
<i>That was the act of a child,
not a businessman, not a friend.</i>

1927
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:57,311
You know how embarrassing it was
for me to try to cash a check today?

1928
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,645
I won't go back to that life.

1929
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,564
<i>- Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah.

1930
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:02,942
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was.

1931
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,194
But I am willing
to let bygones be bygones,

1932
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:08,614
<i>because, Wardo, I've got some good news.</i>

1933
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:09,865
I'm sorry.

1934
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:14,661
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1935
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:17,581
Wardo, I said, I got some good news.

1936
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:18,999
What is it?

1937
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,710
Peter Thiel made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1938
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,045
What?

1939
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:26,924
<i>Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

1940
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,427
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1941
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,304
They need your signature
on some documents.

1942
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,389
Get on the first flight
back to San Francisco.

1943
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:35,683
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

1944
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:42,147
I'm on my way.

1945
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:43,524
<i>- Wardo?</i>
- Yeah?

1946
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:44,942
We did it.

1947
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:49,572
Wardo?

1948
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:52,366
You're going back there already?

1949
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:53,284
Yes.

1950
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:57,580
And also I'm breaking up with you.

1951
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,710
Somebody stop her.

1952
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:06,672
Four documents.

1953
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,715
First two are
common stock purchase agreements,

1954
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,927
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

1955
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:14,805
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

1956
01:38:15,347 --> 01:38:16,848
The third is an exchange agreement,

1957
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:19,476
allowing you
to exchange old shares for new shares.

1958
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,687
And then finally
a voter holding agreement.

1959
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:23,606
How many shares of stock will I own?

1960
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:28,360
- 1,328,334.
- Jesus Christ.

1961
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:31,738
That represents
a 34.4-percent ownership share.

1962
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:34,116
Why the increase
from the original 30 percent?

1963
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,100
You may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

1964
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,997
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

1965
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,081
- Economics.
- Right.

1966
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:46,337
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

1967
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:50,591
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

1968
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,595
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81 percent.

1969
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,641
Sean Parker, 6.47 percent.

1970
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:03,312
- I can live with that.
- And Peter Thiel, 7 percent.

1971
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:09,276
Would you like to use my pen?

1972
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:10,861
<i>Eduardo?</i>

1973
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:13,405
Eduardo?

1974
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:16,033
Please, repeat the question?

1975
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:19,369
It's an outrageously leading question.
You want to hear it twice?

1976
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:22,581
- Yes. Would you read it back, please?
- Well, go ahead.

1977
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,000
"Counsel: 'When you signed the documents,
were you aware

1978
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:27,210
that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

1979
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:28,129
No.

1980
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:36,887
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

1981
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,932
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

1982
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:44,895
I was your only friend.

1983
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:48,232
You had one friend.

1984
01:39:52,903 --> 01:39:54,863
- My father won't even look at me.
- Okay.

1985
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:58,742
Did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything
to you after you signed the papers?

1986
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,329
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

1987
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:06,208
He'd already told me that he
wouldn't be coming back to school

1988
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:07,501
for at least a semester,

1989
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,212
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

1990
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:13,006
Then before I left he said...

1991
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,174
You gotta come back.

1992
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:16,843
Somewhere around
the end of November or early December.

1993
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:19,221
Peter's throwing a party
when we hit a million members.

1994
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:21,306
It'll be out of control.
You gotta come for it.

1995
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,724
A million members?

1996
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:23,642
Yeah.

1997
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:27,396
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

1998
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:29,356
Yeah.

1999
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:34,320
Yeah, I'll be here.

2000
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:40,742
You sure about this?

2001
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:41,993
You're 20 minutes late.

2002
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:44,746
Walk in, say you overslept,
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2003
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,998
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity will pitch you.

2004
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:48,708
They'll beg you to take their money.

2005
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:50,460
You're gonna nod, nod, nod...

2006
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:53,588
And then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2007
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:56,508
No, not Roth. Manningham.
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"

2008
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,509
He'll say, "I am."

2009
01:40:57,593 --> 01:41:01,221
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you.'"

2010
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,139
Walk out.

2011
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,724
Okay.

2012
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,738
In late November,
I got the e-mail from Mark

2013
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:21,116
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2014
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,784
What else did the e-mail say?

2015
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,870
That we had to have a business meeting.

2016
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:29,749
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2017
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,459
<i>and Manningham was so impressed,</i>

2018
01:41:31,543 --> 01:41:34,755
<i>he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.</i>

2019
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:39,051
<i>So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

2020
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,430
<i>I didn't know whether to dress
for the party or for the business meeting,</i>

2021
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,014
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

2022
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,518
<i>- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?</i>

2023
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:50,812
<i>Because I wasn't called there
for either one.</i>

2024
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:52,446
What were you called there for?

2025
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:57,569
An ambush.

2026
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,447
Mr. Saverin. Hey, right over here.

2027
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,121
Hey, man.

2028
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,831
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2029
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,042
- Good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2030
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:15,754
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2031
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:21,677
But then I started reading.

2032
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:26,223
Wait, what is this?

2033
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:30,644
Well, as you know, we had
some new investors that have come in...

2034
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:31,562
What is this?

2035
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:45,075
Mr. Saverin.

2036
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:48,954
Mark.

2037
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:51,957
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2038
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,041
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2039
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,168
- Is he?
- Yes.

2040
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,505
- How about now? You still wired in?
- Call security.

2041
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,841
You issued 24 million new shares of stock.

2042
01:43:02,051 --> 01:43:03,760
You were told that if new investors...

2043
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:06,930
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2044
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,933
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2045
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:12,310
It wasn't.

2046
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:15,855
What was Mr. Moskovitz's
ownership share diluted down to?

2047
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,274
It wasn't.

2048
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:20,235
What was Sean Parker's
ownership share diluted down to?

2049
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,486
It wasn't.

2050
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:24,322
What was Peter Thiel's
ownership share diluted down to?

2051
01:43:24,406 --> 01:43:25,365
It wasn't.

2052
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:28,494
And what was
your ownership share diluted down to?

2053
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:32,081
Point-zero-three percent.

2054
01:43:39,963 --> 01:43:42,257
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2055
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,968
You blame me because
you were the business head of the company,

2056
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,970
and you made a bad deal
with your own company?

2057
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:48,847
It's like I'm not part of Facebook.

2058
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:51,099
Won't be like that.
You're not part of Facebook.

2059
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:52,309
My name's on the masthead.

2060
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:54,936
- You might wanna check again.
- Because I froze the account?

2061
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,230
Think we'd let you
parade around in ridiculous suits?

2062
01:43:57,314 --> 01:44:00,775
- Pretending you run this company?
- Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's.

2063
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:03,194
Along with my hoodie
and my fuck-you flip-flops,

2064
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:05,238
you pretentious douchebag.

2065
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:06,990
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2066
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:09,993
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2067
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:12,277
This isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2068
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:19,085
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken.

2069
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:21,796
- I didn't plant the story.
- What's he talking about?

2070
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,341
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- What's the chicken?

2071
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:26,134
I'll bet what you hated the most

2072
01:44:26,218 --> 01:44:29,971
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2073
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,974
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2074
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,310
Because I'm not coming back
for 30 percent.

2075
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:38,313
I'm coming back for everything.

2076
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:46,277
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2077
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:49,658
Hang on.

2078
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:53,537
Almost forgot.

2079
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,374
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2080
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,208
I drew it on the account you froze.

2081
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,341
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2082
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:09,595
It makes me look so tough.

2083
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,234
Well...

2084
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:27,404
That's it.
That's our show for tonight, people.

2085
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:30,448
I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2086
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:32,534
Walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2087
01:45:32,618 --> 01:45:35,829
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2088
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:40,918
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2089
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,670
You were kind of rough on him.

2090
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:44,963
That's life in the NFL.

2091
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:47,632
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2092
01:45:47,716 --> 01:45:49,635
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean.

2093
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:53,179
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2094
01:45:53,263 --> 01:45:54,389
He almost killed it.

2095
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,352
I'll send flowers.

2096
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:01,354
Speaking of flowers,

2097
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:04,588
I'm putting together a party
after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2098
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:06,192
Ashleigh's a sister.

2099
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:07,902
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2100
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:11,073
Yeah, I know who she is. Are you guys...?

2101
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:12,991
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2102
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:14,826
Well, a little bit.

2103
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:16,786
Why?

2104
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,830
- No, nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2105
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:22,214
- We were just talking about you.
- You're doing a really good job.

2106
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,836
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2107
01:46:26,004 --> 01:46:26,963
These came in for you.

2108
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:28,674
Just put them on my desk.

2109
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,182
What's the package?

2110
01:46:38,016 --> 01:46:38,850
Nothing.

2111
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:43,146
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2112
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,690
Refresh.

2113
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:46,149
Sweet.

2114
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:53,657
And you're not a hugger.

2115
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:55,492
I know.

2116
01:46:58,495 --> 01:46:59,913
One million.

2117
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,293
Who's got champagne, huh?

2118
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:07,296
I've got champagne.

2119
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:30,860
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2120
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,072
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2121
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,991
It is the true digitalization
of real life.

2122
01:47:37,075 --> 01:47:39,619
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2123
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,579
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2124
01:47:41,663 --> 01:47:45,291
You go to a party with a digital camera.
Then your friends relive the party online.

2125
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:46,876
And tagging. The idea...

2126
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,836
Would this be easier without the bra?

2127
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,070
It's worth finding out.

2128
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,765
All right, shut the music down.

2129
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:02,183
The party's over.

2130
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:04,477
Everybody, go home.

2131
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,980
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2132
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:10,108
- They check their friends' status updates.
- Wait. Why did the music stop?

2133
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,278
Check to see which friends
changed their profiles, their photos.

2134
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,946
What happened to the music?

2135
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,031
We lived on farms.
Then we lived in cities.

2136
01:48:17,115 --> 01:48:19,117
Now we're going to live on the Internet.

2137
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:20,660
Sean, stop.

2138
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,788
I think something's going on downstairs.

2139
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,632
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2140
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:37,427
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2141
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:40,430
Then it's all good.

2142
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:42,974
- It's the cops.
- What?

2143
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,183
Shit. Shit.

2144
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:47,145
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2145
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,830
Good to see you, officer.
What can I do for you?

2146
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:52,859
What's going on?

2147
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:55,570
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2148
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,155
Miss, button your blouse.

2149
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,199
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2150
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:04,996
That's not mine.

2151
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,416
We're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2152
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,001
Oh, my God.

2153
01:49:10,085 --> 01:49:11,878
You got anything else in your pockets?

2154
01:49:11,962 --> 01:49:13,046
No, sir. No.

2155
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:15,480
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't. I...

2156
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:21,263
What's this?

2157
01:49:22,097 --> 01:49:23,223
That's an EpiPen.

2158
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:26,601
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2159
01:49:28,019 --> 01:49:28,895
How old are you?

2160
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,064
Twenty-one.

2161
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:33,149
Twenty-one.

2162
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:34,734
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2163
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,319
Lying only makes it worse.

2164
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:39,531
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2165
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:52,293
Hello.

2166
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:55,172
Listen, something's happened.

2167
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:03,221
Shit.

2168
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:05,306
No, it's all right.
It's gonna be all right.

2169
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:08,309
I posted bond,
and I wasn't doing anything.

2170
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:09,394
I've got allergies.

2171
01:50:14,357 --> 01:50:15,191
Interns.

2172
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:17,277
It was just a party.

2173
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:23,325
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2174
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:25,493
I know.

2175
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:27,286
You know with an intern...

2176
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,539
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2177
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,290
I will get it under control.

2178
01:50:31,374 --> 01:50:33,710
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2179
01:50:33,794 --> 01:50:35,295
But this is gonna be news now.

2180
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:38,589
You don't think
Wardo was involved, do you?

2181
01:50:38,673 --> 01:50:40,467
- I mean, do you think...?
- No.

2182
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:43,636
Or Manningham. One of them. Somebody.

2183
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,305
Somebody sent the coke in there,
because it got in there.

2184
01:50:46,389 --> 01:50:48,289
You believe me. This is gonna be fine.

2185
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:53,897
Right?

2186
01:50:57,025 --> 01:50:58,151
Go home, Sean.

2187
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,835
<i>Mark?</i>

2188
01:51:17,128 --> 01:51:17,963
<i>Mark.</i>

2189
01:51:20,549 --> 01:51:22,175
We're done for the day.

2190
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,761
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2191
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:29,850
What happened to Sean?

2192
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,853
He still owns 7 percent of the company.

2193
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:40,902
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2194
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:42,988
I can't.

2195
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:51,954
I'm not a bad guy.

2196
01:51:52,038 --> 01:51:53,331
I know that.

2197
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:57,418
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85 percent of it is exaggeration.

2198
01:51:57,502 --> 01:51:59,003
And the other 15?

2199
01:51:59,087 --> 01:51:59,921
Perjury.

2200
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,424
Creation myths need a devil.

2201
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:07,137
What happens now?

2202
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:13,017
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2203
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:14,685
Then they'll come back to the office,

2204
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:17,980
and start working on
a settlement agreement to present to you.

2205
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:19,764
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2206
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:23,402
- You're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2207
01:52:23,486 --> 01:52:25,738
So these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2208
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:28,783
They say one unflattering word in public,
you own their wife and kids.

2209
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,076
I invented Facebook.

2210
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,411
I'm talking about a jury.

2211
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:35,081
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

2212
01:52:35,165 --> 01:52:37,500
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2213
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:40,002
Clothes, hair,
speaking style, likability...

2214
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:41,295
Likability.

2215
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:44,340
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2216
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:45,842
and I could get a jury to believe

2217
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:48,594
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2218
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:49,637
Watch what else.

2219
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:52,271
Why weren't you
at Sean's sorority party that night?

2220
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:55,226
- You think I called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2221
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,436
I asked the question.
Now everybody's thinking it.

2222
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,814
You've lost your jury
in the first 10 minutes.

2223
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:02,400
Farm animals.

2224
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:03,318
Yeah.

2225
01:53:04,694 --> 01:53:07,113
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2226
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,197
And blogging.

2227
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:09,240
And blogging.

2228
01:53:10,825 --> 01:53:11,660
Pay them.

2229
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:13,494
In the scheme of things,

2230
01:53:13,578 --> 01:53:15,246
it's a speeding ticket.

2231
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:19,232
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2232
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:22,420
Would anybody mind if I stay
and use the computer for a minute?

2233
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:24,255
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2234
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,173
Thanks.

2235
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,551
I appreciate your help today.

2236
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,265
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2237
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:37,936
You're just trying so hard to be.
