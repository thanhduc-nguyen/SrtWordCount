00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,118
minions

3
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:47,649
Minions

4
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:52,218
Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.

5
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:53,947
They go by many names.

6
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:57,579
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.

7
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:01,119
Oh, that one is Norbert.

8
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,329
He's an idiot.

9
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:07,284
They're all different.
But they all share the same goal.

10
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:10,612
To serve the most despicable
master they could find.

11
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,497
BOSS!

12
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,323
- Boss.
- Boss.

13
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:21,955
Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.

14
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,082
But that's not to say that
they didn’t have other passions.

15
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,026
- Hey, look. It's a banana.
- Move over.

16
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:32,643
Hey, I know. It's a banana.
Ha-hah-ha.

17
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:34,638
Yum yum.
Huh?

18
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:37,200
Finding a Boss was easy.

19
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:42,231
But keeping a Boss...
therein lies the rub.

20
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,121
Ow.

21
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,574
Ow.
Owww.

22
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,469
Whoa!

23
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:56,554
Oh.

24
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:58,972
- Oop.
- Aw.

25
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,218
- Oh.
- Oh.

26
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,767
I am... oaf.
Aw.

27
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,196
Nope,
it wasn't easy for these guys.

28
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:27,601
But they never gave up.

29
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:32,748
With the emergence of the stone age
came the rise of a new species.

30
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,430
Man was very different
from the dinosaur.

31
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:40,859
He was shorter, hairier
and way, way smarter.

32
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:51,634
The minions took an instant liking to Man
and helped him as best they could.

33
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,072
Oh, no no...
Here. A present.

34
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,796
- This?
- Yes yes yes.

35
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,309
For hitting.
Ut-ut.

36
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:07,943
Aw!

37
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:14,932
Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile, so-so delicious.

38
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:18,084
Their quest for a boss put
the minions front and center

39
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,648
for some of the civilization
most historic moments.

40
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,997
Ancient Egypt held great promise.

41
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:31,285


42
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,939
Okay!

43
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,046


44
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,906
But it didn't last long.

45
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:40,734
Hmm.
Oh.

46
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,313
Here.
Yup.

47
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:43,600
Ow!

48
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:47,993
The dark ages
were actually fun times.

49
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:54,294
Their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day.

50
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:57,025
Ahem.
Yoo-hoo.

51
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:02,477


52
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,168
<font color="#ff9b9b">[Happy Birthday]

53
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:10,467
Oh.

54
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:13,582
But eventually
the party was over.

55
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:15,975
Achoo.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,975
They bounced from
one evil master to another.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,622
But they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.

58
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,951
One particular employer took
their failure very very badly.

59
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,286
Huh?

60
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:44,711
The Minions had no other
choice but to keep moving.

61
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,114
Oh.
Look.

62
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,367
And then,
when all hopes seem lost.

63
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:55,063
They found sanctuary.

64
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,699
The Minions were safe.

65
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:29,632
Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.

66
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,546
They truly made a life
for themselves.

67
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:35,619
But something just wasn't right.

68
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:45,249
They felt empty inside.
Without a master, they had no purpose.

69
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,139
They became aimless

70
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:49,291
and depressed.

71
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:59,106
If this continue any longer,
the Minions would perish.

72
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:05,461
But all was not lost,
for one Minion had a plan.

73
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:08,907
His name was Kevin.

74
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:14,016
He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.

75
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:18,773
He'd been preparing for
days, weeks, months.

76
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:21,584
But now he was ready.

77
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,781
Buddies.

78
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:47,468
Kevin would leave the cave,
go back to the outside world

79
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,059
and he would not return
until he had found his tribe

80
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:53,284
the biggest baddest villain deserved.

81
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,238
But he needed help.

82
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:57,765
Me! Me!
I will come.

83
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,287
Bob was eager to go.
- Kevin?

84
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,476
But Kevin felt he was just not strong enough
for the dangerous journey ahead.

85
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,696
Uh no.
One other Minion?

86
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,126
Me.
Choose me.

87
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,220
Me! Choose me!
Aw.

88
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,330
Me!

89
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,296
I will come.

90
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:14,976
Luckily someone stepped up.

91
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:17,462
- Huh?
- Stuart! Come here.

92
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,691
Huh. Me? Me?
Oh, thank you.

93
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,623
Truth be told. Stuart had no idea
what he was chose for.

94
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:25,135
Huh!
Wh-Why?

95
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,150
But was thrilled that made
people cheered for him.

96
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,965
Uh.
Stuart, Stuart.

97
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,281
One more?

98
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,740
ME!
I am strong.

99
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,508
See here.

100
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,307
See!

101
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,912
- Oh.
- Oh.

102
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:48,315
Uh... okay.
One more.

103
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,232
Kevin.
Choose me.

104
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:53,149
Please.
Choose me, Kevin.

105
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,406
Come here.

106
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:55,561
Huh.
Yeah! Ha ha.

107
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:57,843
Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm

108
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:02,477
but mostly lack of other volunteers
changed Kevin's mind.

109
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:05,281
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!

110
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:06,953
Kumbaya.

111
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,503
Big boss!
Big boss!

112
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,371
The tribe said their farewells.

113
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:14,135
Kevin had given them something
they haven't had  in a long time.

114
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,044
- Hope.
- Kevin!

115
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,587
- Bob!
- (Big boss! Big boss!)

116
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:20,025
Hey,Tony.
Good luck to you.

117
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,667
Tom.
Take care.

118
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:24,550
And Chris.
See you later.

119
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:28,079
- Hey Bob, you coming?
- Yes, yes.

120
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:31,401
Big boss!
Big boss!

121
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,901
Bye bye.

122
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:41,232
Kevin felt pride.

123
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:44,739
He was going to be the
one to save his tribe.

124
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,796
Stuart felt,
hungry mostly.

125
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,046
He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.

126
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:54,701
- And Bob
- Oh.

127
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:59,003
Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.

128
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,110


129
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,906
Okay. Okay.
Look for the big boss.

130
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,389
Ah. There you go, Bob.
Come on.

131
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,964
And they were off.

132
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:21,215
Off,
to find their new boss.

133
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:24,351
Come on, Bob.

134
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:42,886
Huh?
Kevin?

135
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:03,536
Oh.

136
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,534
- Hungry?
- Food?

137
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:08,630
There is no food.

138
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:10,750
Huh.
Banana.

139
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,839
Uh.
Stuart, What it it?

140
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,729
Banana.

141
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:17,963
- Banana!
- Aww.

142
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,004
- Stuart.
- Food.

143
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,624
Stop!

144
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,516
Bob!
Stop!

145
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:38,270
Huh.
Oh. Land!

00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:39,547

- I can smell him from here!
- Junior, get my camera.

354
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:30,644
Good luck in there, boys.

355
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:32,728
I hope you find what
you are looking for.

356
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,902
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

357
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:38,189
And here we come,
Villain-Con!

358
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:39,481
- Ha ha.
- Yeah!

359
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:42,380
- Villain-Con.
- Ya! Hoo.

361

<font color="#6ab5ff">[FREEZE-RAY]</font>
- Whoa.

362
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,025
Any evil talents?

363
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,522
Not bad.

364
00:25:56,547 --> 00:25:59,818
What about you?
Any evil talents?

365
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:04,283
Hello. La la la.
La la la. Eh?

366
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:07,484
That's not evil,
or a talent.

367
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,329
Hello!
Ahaa! Ha ha.

368
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:19,548
No?

369
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:23,252
I'm sorry, but I'm not looking
for any more servants.

370
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,692
For I,
Professor Flux,

371
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,404
have invented the
world's first Time machine!

372
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,793
Every time I visit the future,

373
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:35,846
I bring my future
self back to help me.

374
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,536
Hello.

375
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,279
Who's that over there,
Professor Flux from 2 weeks from now?

376
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,609
As you can see,
I don't need any help.

377
00:26:47,097 --> 00:26:51,517
Oh. Way to go, guys.
We killed the original.

378
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,880
- Huh!
- Aw!

379
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,541
Please.

380
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:02,483
<I> Villain-Con,
I present our keynote speaker. </I>

381
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:08,840
Scarlet Overkill.
The world's first female super-villain.

382
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:12,374
Appearing right now in Hall H.
- Bob, Stuart, buddies.

383
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,609
Buddies, let's go.
It's Scarlet Overkill.

384
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,627
- Scarlet?
- Come on. Come on.

385
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:18,073
Kevin.

386
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:22,633
Are you ready...

387
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:28,068
for
Scarlet Overkill.

388
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,702
Ha.

389
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:34,355
Doesn't it feel so good
to be bad?

390
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,156
- Scarlet-Scarlet-Scarlet...
- Yes!
- Hoo-hoo-hoo.

391
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,141
Ha-ha-ha...

392
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,900
- Whoa.
- Wow.

393
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:00,708
Scarlet!

394
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:05,020
Whoa. Ha ha.
What beauty.

395
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:08,289
Wow.
Thank you.

396
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:12,183
Thank you so much.

397
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,739
Okay.
Shh shh shh.

398
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:19,784
When I started out,
people said a woman could

399
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:24,442
never rob a bank
as well as a man. Well.

400
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:28,006
Time's changed.

401
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:29,706
I love you, Scarlet!

402
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:34,833
Look at all those faces out there,
we are all so different.

403
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:37,149
But we have
one thing in common.

404
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,880
We were born with flippers!

405
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,300
No?
Just me?

406
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,949
Okay.

407
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:51,828
We have big dreams, and we will
do anything to make them come true.

408
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:54,448
Have any of you ever dreamt

409
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:59,623
of working for the greatest
supervillain of all time?

410
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,017
Heh-heh-heh.
Well.

411
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,225
What if I were
to tell you,

412
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,115
that I am looking
for a new henchman!

413
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,171
Hey, big boss.
This is our chance.

414
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:13,278
- Yes.
- Ha.

415
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:16,492
I truly believe
somewhere out there

416
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:20,629
is a villain with the potential
to serve greatness.

417
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:24,389
- And it could be any of you.
- Whoa.

418
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:26,761
Although let's not kid ourselves.

419
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:32,173
Truly the only man for this job
are Kevin and his Minions.

420
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,963
10 times the evil in
half the package.

421
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:36,830
I'm just in awe.

422
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:42,071
Let's hear it for Kevin.
He saved his tribe!

423
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:45,817
Kevin!
Kevin!

424
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:48,356
- Kevin Kevin Kev...
- Hey, Kevin. Hey.

425
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:50,934
- Argh!
- Hey. Pay attention.

426
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,488
So.
How should we do this?

427
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:57,113
Hmm.
Oh.

428
00:29:57,138 --> 00:29:59,564
You see this
tiny little trinket?

429
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,125
Well, just take it from my hand
and you got the job.

430
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,114
No big deal,
it's almost too simple.

431
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:05,753
Eh heh heh.

432
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:10,421
Oh, come on, don't be afraid.
Just take the stone and get that job.

433
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:12,212
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

434
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:14,153
Let's go get our boss.
Come on.

435
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:17,439
- That job is mine.
- Ooh.

436
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:25,680
Now, go easy on me.

437
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:27,735
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

438
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,108
Aw!

439
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,732
Love the costume.

440
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:33,297
Ha!

441
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,027
So cool!

442
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,554
Wait
Wait.

443
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,624
Tim?
Tim!

444
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,335
Oh.

445
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,749
Oh no, Bob.
He's over there.

446
00:30:49,774 --> 00:30:50,658
Ah.
Stop.

447
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,868
- Is no one good enough?
- Stop. Tim.

448
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:57,765
Bob!

449
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,523
Hi ya!

450
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,469
Tim!

451
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:06,815
There he is.

452
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,668
Bob!

453
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:17,350
Aw!

454
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,199
Didn't my speech inspired anyone

455
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:23,542
to rise up and prove
themselves worthy?

456
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:27,426
All these villains, and yet
I still have the- bear.

457
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,552
Stuffed bear.
Why am I holding a bear?

458
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:32,512
- Oh.
- Who has the ruby?

459
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:42,160
Wow.
Who-Who are you?

460
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:46,128
My... knights
in shiny denim.

461
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:49,145
- I'm Kevin. This is Stuart.
- Yo.
- And Bob.

462
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,361
- Minions!
- That was incredible.

463
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:56,445
Behold, the last creatures
you expect to win the day

464
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,713
have emerged victorious.

465
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:01,532
Everyone,
meet my new henchmen.

466
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:03,584
The Minions!

467
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:07,641
- Kumbaya! Ha ha!
- Kumbaya!

468
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,677
Kumbaya!

469
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:14,071
Hey! I know those guys.
I gave them a ride here.

470
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:17,142
Woo.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

471
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:23,027
Buckle up, boys.
Next stop, England.

472
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:54,432
Ah.
Pick it up.

473
00:32:56,981 --> 00:32:58,496
1, 2

474
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,746
1 2 3!

475
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:23,661
Hello.
Hey, Kevin.

476
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:26,523
Huh?
The boss, in England.

477
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,696
Nah. We found a boss.
Listen.

478
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:42,851
Ah. Uh...
Hello, Kevin.

479
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,840
Did-Did you say England?

480
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,389
Uh-huh.
The boss, yes.

481
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:49,195
Scarlet Overkill.
Ah.

482
00:33:57,987 --> 00:33:59,497
Hello.
Hello?

483
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,386
Oh. He hung up.
Hello.

484
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,902
Wow.

485
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:24,770
Here we go.
Come here.

486
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:28,191
By the way.
I really like your bear.

487
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:31,937
- Herb, my baby.
- You know I am.

488
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:34,836
How did it go?
Were you evil?

489
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,738
- So evil.
- Oh!

490
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:40,115
A little bird dropped
this off today.

491
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,051
<font color="#ff80c0">I Missed You!
♥ H.</font>

492
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:45,485
It's me,
I'm the "H".

493
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,779
Also, there's no birds.
Also me.

494
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:50,216
Herb, seriously.

495
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,383
I want to dig up that
William Shakespeare,

496
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:54,933
so he can see
what true writing is.

497
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,443
I love it.

498
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,264
That works because I love you.

499
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:02,102
Well, I love you too.

500
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:04,472
Oh.
The love, oh.

501
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:09,609
Oh, boys.
Could you come here please?

502
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:16,672
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

503
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,971
Herb, these are the new recruits.

504
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,393
Kevin, Stuart and
that cute little one is Bob.

505
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,306
Right on. You guys
are crazy little and

506
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:30,656
way yellow,
and I digged that.

507
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,814
Sweet, man.

508
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:41,752
- Wow.
- Cool house.

509
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:43,695
I know, right?

510
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,403
Just a few thing I stole
to help fill the void.

511
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:50,927
Whoa.
A mega ukulele.

512
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:54,485
Checking out my can?

513
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,889
We stole that because finally

514
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,561
someone expressed my love
of soup in painting form.

515
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:00,178
- Wow.
- Woo.

516
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:04,773
Okay, listen up.
It is time to get down to business.

517
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:07,031
Do you know who this is?

518
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:08,912
Uh.
The cockroach?

519
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:13,219
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

520
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:17,539
Oh. I love England.
The music, the fashion.

521
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:20,942
I'm seriously thinking about
overthrowing it someday.

522
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:22,492
- I'm so excited.
- Yes.

523
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:26,100
Anyway. This pale drink of water
oversees it all.

524
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,068
I'm her biggest fan,
love her work.

525
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:32,690
And I really really really
want her crown.

526
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:39,351
Steal me the crown and
all your dreams come true.

527
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:40,852
Respect!

528
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:41,925
Power!

529
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,760
Banana!

530
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,216
Banana!

531
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,136
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

532
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:57,831
Huh!
Henry!

533
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,340
The way to England,
is... is...

534
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:04,755
Ah!
Give me.

535
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,281
Uh. England is...
this way.

536
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:09,609
March on!
Eh!

537
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:21,503
Wait for me!
Wait for me! Ah!

538
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,276
Go back!

539
00:37:32,908 --> 00:37:35,611
- Hm. What is this place?
- Hey. Over there.

540
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:37,428
- Whoa.
- Wow.

541
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:39,654
Whoa oh.
Uu la la.

542
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,224
No.
Oh, no.

543
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:42,792
Don't get too close, boys.

544
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,401
When it's completed, it will
be my ultimate weapon. But.

545
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:50,141
Right now, it's leaking radiation.
Like you would not believe.

546
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,884
So you're here
for gear.

547
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,191
Whoa.

548
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,454
- Bob, Robert, Bobby my boy.
- Yes?

549
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,498
You get my far-out
stretch suit.

550
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,429
Wow.

551
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:10,615
Kevin, Kevo, Seventh Kevin.

552
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,518
You are the proud owner
of my Lava Lamp gun.

553
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:17,670
This baby shoots actual lava!

554
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,251
- Woo, for me?
- Pretty cool, right?

555
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:25,524
And finally, Stu, Stu-art,
Stu-perman, Beef Stu.

556
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:29,003
I got you the coolest invention,
probably ever.

557
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:32,905
- Hypno hat!
- Uh, oh.

558
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,007
You can use it
to hypnotize anyone.

559
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,367
Anyone!

560
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:45,192
Oh, you look so great.

561
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:49,174
I feel like a proud mama
with 3 dashing evil sons.

562
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,768
Uh.
Scarlet. Scarlet.

563
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:52,278
There is something
wrong with this.

564
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:55,355
No, no, don't say anything,
I won't understand.

565
00:38:55,387 --> 00:39:00,059
It's getting late, you had a big day.
You must be exhausted.

566
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:03,607
Boing. Boing.
Boing. Boing.

567
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,887
Wow, these cats are pumped!

568
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:10,911
Well, maybe I'll settle them down
with a bedtime story.

569
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,566
How does that sound, Bob?

570
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:18,990
Bob? Bob?
Bob!

571
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:20,450
Oh.
Bedtime story?

572
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,140
That is a groovy idea,

573
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:23,827
I'll go get some
cookies and warm milk.

574
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:27,668
This is going to be so fun!

575
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,243
And the bedtime porry.

576
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:34,065
Oh, yes, I've got a really really
good bedtime porry.

577
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:39,131
Once upon a time,
there were 3 little pigs.

578
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:45,695
One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big bad wolf,

579
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:49,386
who had a wonderful
surprise for them,

580
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:54,370
The wolf offered the 3 piggies and
all their friends a job working for her.

581
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:57,620
Everyone would be so happy!

582
00:39:58,087 --> 00:40:01,718
All the 3 little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown.

583
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:03,730
That the beautiful wolf
had wanted ever since

584
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:07,365
she was a penniless
little street cub.

585
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,163
Unloved and abandoned.

586
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:14,750
But that crown would mean
she was a princess.

587
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:16,974
And everybody loves the princess.

588
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,400
So, the wolf sent the
piggies to get that crown.

589
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:24,286
But the little piggies weren't
up to the challenge.

590
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:26,565
They failed their mission.

591
00:40:26,597 --> 00:40:29,683
So the wolf huffed and puffed

592
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:33,435
and she blew them off
 the face of the earth!

593
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:36,021
Yo, po, po!

594
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,461
The end.

595
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,847
Good luck getting the crown
tomorrow, little piggies.

596
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,505
I know you won't disappoint me.

- Holah!

Well, you're going to
have to get through me!

You think it's funny to
mock the elderly, do you?

635
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,235
Uh.
Yes.

636
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,263

and steal the queen's treasure.

00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:36,553
Okay.
Me will do it.

639

Never mind, don't care!

00:49:57,715 --> 00:50:00,872
Ha, buddy.
Ah-ha-ha...

705
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:20,111
King Bob!

706
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:21,579
- Yeh!
- Hurray!

707
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,198
- Long live the king!
- King Bob!

708
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:03,417
King Bob!

709
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:05,356
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

710
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:15,532
Whoa, wait.

711
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:28,284
- Yee-ha!
- King Bob.

712
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:31,253
Grill chicken!

713
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:47,337
Yes, King Bob?

714
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:51,253
King Bob?

715
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:53,214
King Bob?

716
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:56,282
Ah, Claire.
Hm, Tiffany.

717
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:58,158
My beauties.

718
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,152
Ball!
Yah!

719
00:52:07,177 --> 00:52:08,493
How dare you?

720
00:52:08,518 --> 00:52:09,985
AW!

721
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,358
Scarlet.

722
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:21,080
Don't you "Scarlet" me.
You backstabbing little traitors!

723
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:24,706
Using Herb's inventions
to steal my crown!

724
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:28,615
I feel used,
not going to lie.

725
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,326
You stole my dream.

726
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:34,442
I was going to conquer
England some day.

727
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:36,451
There was going
to be a coronation.

728
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:39,082
And I was going
to be made queen.

729
00:52:39,107 --> 00:52:41,034
Every moment was planned.

730
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:44,393
I would wear a dress
so sparkly, it glowed.

731
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:47,523
And everyone whoever doubted me

732
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:51,744
would be watching,
and they would be crying.

733
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,259
I was going to be the picture
of elegance and class!

734
00:52:55,284 --> 00:52:58,127
And you pinheads
screwed it up!

735
00:52:58,152 --> 00:53:00,653
No no no.
The crown, for you.

736
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:02,749
No, no no.
King Bob.

737
00:53:02,774 --> 00:53:05,539
You cannot just
abdicate the throne.

738
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:07,394
Who invited the square?

739
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:11,043
And you definitely cannot just
give the job to this woman.

740
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:12,772
There are laws.

741
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:15,424
Laws?
What laws?

742
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,644
I give my place to
Scarlet Overkill.

743
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,988
King Bob has official
changed the law.

744
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:27,756
Clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill
to be crowned Queen of England.

745
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:31,105
She will be coronated at London's
historic Westminster Abbey.

746
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,526
If I'm wasn't so polite,

747
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:35,136
I'd say this spells certain
doom for the country,

748
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:36,613
if not, the world.

749
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:40,390
But, I'm so very polite,
that I shall keep my mouth shut.

750
00:53:40,415 --> 00:53:43,226
But, seriously,
we are all in big trouble.

751
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:45,442
- Scarlet
- Ms. Overkill.

752
00:53:45,595 --> 00:53:48,139
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

753
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:49,871
I'm just want to thank
the minions for

754
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:53,161
going above and beyond
the call of duty.

755
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:58,955
You are 3 tiny golden
pill shaped miracle workers.

756
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,396
And you have stolen not just England,
but my heart.

757
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:05,685
- Scarlet, over here.
- Over here.

758
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,353
Show her,
the buddies.

759
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:08,988
Pardon Me?

760
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:14,142
Wow, so many.
[ERiC], [NORBERT]

761
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,830
Good for you,

762
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,929
Well.
You'll all get what you deserved.

763
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:21,392
Serve. 
We get to serve.

764
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:24,714
Woo hoo!

765
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:49,171
Oh.

766
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,982
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

767
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:57,796
Buttocks.

768
00:55:03,281 --> 00:55:05,450
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way.

769
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:06,805
But I hate you.

770
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,046
I thought I could
get over what you did.

771
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:12,145
But I feel so betrayed.

772
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,368
I think, yes, I think
we're gonna have to break up.

773
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:18,708
And it's not you.

774
00:55:18,963 --> 00:55:20,170
Oh wait, hold on.

775
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:22,717
It is you.
It's a 100% you.

776
00:55:22,742 --> 00:55:24,247
Huh.
No no.

777
00:55:24,272 --> 00:55:28,605
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real real comfortable.

778
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,880
Because this is where
you're going to spend

779
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:36,301
the rest of your
worthless little lives.

780
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:40,815
Alright, let's do this.

781
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,610
Look.
Look, it's Herb.

782
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:47,037
Who's this handsome "Herb" fellow?
No, My name is Blerb.

783
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:48,822
I'm a-a dungeon master.

784
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:52,087
Prepared for torture
which I do.

785
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:54,746
Alright, are we comfy?

786
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:58,602
Doesn't matter.
This is TORTURE!

787
00:56:01,716 --> 00:56:03,269
- Oh.
- Uh, anything?

788
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:04,348
No no.
My sunshine.

789
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:07,742
Wow, harder than I thought.
Next machine.

790
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:13,449
Oh, welcome to hang town.
Population: You.

791
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:22,419
Cut it out.
This is really unprofessional.

792
00:56:22,444 --> 00:56:23,892
No laughing in the dungeon.

793
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:26,458
I want to see tears and
I want to hear screams.

794
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,166
Or I'm going to get...

795
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:29,428
- Wait.
- Hey.

796
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:32,529
Oh, I've got a groovy idea.

797
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:37,025
Look at this.
Ah-ha-ha.

798
00:56:42,307 --> 00:56:45,591
Hello, will the future King,
Herb Overkill,

799
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:47,959
please come upstairs to
prepare for the coronation.

800
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:51,172
Well, I hope you learn
your lesson for today.

801
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:57,602
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time.

802
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:01,716
I don't even know
anyone named Blerb.

803
00:57:05,204 --> 00:57:10,431
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England.

804
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:12,346
I know,
it's a gas.

805
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:14,473
- I will finally get my crown.
- Yeah.

806
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:15,978
It's all I ever wanted.

807
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:19,126
I'm going to be so happy.

808
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:22,334
But, let me ask you
something, Fabrice.

809
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:26,694
Does that, look like
this to you?

810
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,646
Mrs. Overkill.

811
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:33,401
The hair in that picture,
it's just 2 wavy lines.

812
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:36,332
Oh. So what now,
you're an art critic?

813
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:39,234
I drew that when
I was 5 years old.

814
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:41,539
Get out of my sight.

815
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:46,506
Bye, Fabrice!

816
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:49,306
I liked him,
he was fun.

817
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:50,873
So, what do you think
of the dress?

818
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:53,095
Oh, it's so beautiful,

819
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,552
so fashion forward,
so Valentino.

820
00:57:57,577 --> 00:58:00,211
Gave it a sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.

821
00:58:00,236 --> 00:58:04,435
The high collar and cinched waist 
reflect a simpler more violent time.

822
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,227
The material is a blend of taffeta

823
00:58:06,252 --> 00:58:08,039
and high density body armor.

824
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,268
Fully armed and loaded.

825
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:13,471
And they glow.
That's nuclear.

826
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:16,161
Nice.
Just one more thing to do.

827
00:58:16,186 --> 00:58:18,439
Got to look good
for the public.

828
00:58:19,102 --> 00:58:21,862
- Do you mind?
- My pleasure.

829
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:26,166
A little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

830
00:58:26,191 --> 00:58:28,115
A little tighter.

831
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:29,581
Tighter.

832
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:33,643
Must have tiny waist.

833
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:36,243
Seeing stars.
Seeing stars.

834
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:37,628
Losing feeling in my legs.

835
00:58:37,653 --> 00:58:39,795
Perfect.
Tie it, tie it, tie it, tie it.

836
00:58:42,915 --> 00:58:44,116
Huh?

837
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:47,160
Ah.
Bob, Stuart.

838
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,818
- Huh?
- Help me.

839
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:50,558
Lift up.
Lift up.

840
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:52,944
Lift up.
Lift up.

841
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:55,622
Help me.
Help me!

- Move. Move.
- Can we just go back.

850

Hey, Kevin.
Look. For Scarlet.

851

Ah, okay.
This way out.

Ha ha.
Let's find Scarlet.

859
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:05,662
I love you, Scarlet!

860
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:10,038
Queen wave. Queen wave.
Queen waving.

861
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:21,272
I'm so-so excited.
This is perfect.

862
01:00:21,297 --> 01:00:23,366
Everyone looks so nice.

863
01:00:23,391 --> 01:00:27,595
Oh, you're just adorable.

864
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,009
Oh.
Yes!

865
01:00:30,034 --> 01:00:32,250
And that music.
Eh.

866
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:35,149
Who is that organist?
She's good.

867
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,080
Right?
She looks like an Edna.

868
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:38,611
- Edna! 
- Who's that?

869
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,859
- You're very good.
- Whoa!

870
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:46,722
Thanks for doing this, Padre.
Big fan.

871
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,420
Come here, let me squeeze you.

872
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:50,960
Woo.
You're so squishy.

873
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,226
There, Scarlet.

874
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:57,911
Go go go.

875
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,550
Whoa.
Arh!

876
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:08,456
Heh heh.
Move aside.

877
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:09,718
Oh.

878
01:01:09,973 --> 01:01:12,365
Ouch.
Ouch...

879
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:13,504
Up there.

880
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:15,192
Up-Up there?
My Puchi?

881
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,906
Your Puchi, bye bye.
Come on!

882
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:19,237
Oh.
Bye, Puchi.

883
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:34,191
- Oh, Bob. Come on!
- Aww.

884
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:37,404
- Stuart!
- Yes-yes-yes...

885
01:01:44,192 --> 01:01:46,304
Hello.
Yoo hoo.

886
01:01:52,962 --> 01:01:54,386
Oh.
Bee.

887
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:58,922
Will you to your power cause
Law and Justice,

888
01:01:58,947 --> 01:02:00,874
Come on.
It's Overkill.

889
01:02:07,354 --> 01:02:09,182
Sorry.
Sorry.

890
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,054
Stop!
I am not a stupid.

891
01:02:20,061 --> 01:02:22,269
in Mercy,

892
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:26,739
Oh.
No no.

893
01:02:27,019 --> 01:02:30,089
Do you Scarlet Overkill

894
01:02:37,444 --> 01:02:40,103
That's it!
Yeah!

895
01:02:41,942 --> 01:02:45,280
No!
No. No.

896
01:02:58,337 --> 01:03:00,654
Come on. Come on.
Grab my hand.

897
01:03:03,533 --> 01:03:04,625
I'm stuck.

898
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:11,426
I proclaim thee, Scarlet Overkill,
the Queen of England.

899
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:15,672
Kevin!

900
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:25,644
Scarlet! Scarlet.
My queen.

901
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:28,092
Somebody help me!

902
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:31,999
Come on, come on.
Lift on 2.

903
01:03:32,038 --> 01:03:33,885
1, 2!

904
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,506
1, 2!

905
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,062
Scarlet, you're okay.

906
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:51,768
He tried to kill me!

907
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,375
No.
I wasn't...

908
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,372
Villains. This is no
longer a coronation.

909
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:59,069
It is an execution!

910
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:01,236
Get them!

911
01:04:05,192 --> 01:04:08,807
Whoa Nelly!
Run fellows, run!

912
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:15,963
Come back here, you!

913
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:25,664
In there.

914
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:53,648
- Guys.
- Kevin.

915
01:04:53,673 --> 01:04:54,849
You are mine!

916
01:04:54,874 --> 01:04:56,699
Stuart. Bob.
Huh?

917
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:01,217
Grill chicken!

918
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,659
Come on, Bob.
Come on.

919
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:10,258
Ha-ha-ha...
Oops.

920
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,779
- Oh.
- Rats.

921
01:05:14,804 --> 01:05:17,236
Hey.
I've got one!

922
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,499
Look there.

923
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,120
Ha ha ha.

924
01:05:36,885 --> 01:05:38,188
Tim.

925
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,699
Oh? 
Aww! Oh!

926
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,126
Tim!

927
01:05:57,105 --> 01:05:59,524
Stuart.
Bob.

928
01:05:59,632 --> 01:06:01,476
Hope they are alright.

929
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,416
Hoy, buddies.

930
01:06:05,845 --> 01:06:08,008
Mind the gap.

931
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,617
Mind the gap.

932
01:06:13,957 --> 01:06:15,057
- England.
- England.

933
01:06:15,082 --> 01:06:16,818
Mind the gap.

934
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:18,899
Mind the gap!

935
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:20,943
He won't get away!

936
01:06:20,968 --> 01:06:22,805
He won't escape us!

937
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:31,560
Now, what about this one.

938
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:34,710
Why did the Queen
go to the dentist?

939
01:06:34,735 --> 01:06:37,918
To get her teeth crowned.
Ha-ha-ha.

940
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:39,439
Ha.
The queen.

941
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:42,244
Tell us another one, Lizzy!

942
01:06:42,356 --> 01:06:43,792
Uh.
Hello.

943
01:06:43,817 --> 01:06:45,854
Oh, it's you.

944
01:06:45,879 --> 01:06:48,734
Everyone, this is one
of the little fellows

945
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:51,060
who stole the monarchy from me.

946
01:06:51,085 --> 01:06:54,406
And hows that
working out for you?

947
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:57,013
Oh, yes yes.

948
01:06:57,038 --> 01:06:58,915
I saw what was going
on, on the telly.

949
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,987
Uh.
Telly?

950
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:02,955
What was meant to be the
coronation of Scarlet Overkill

951
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,726
has gone terribly wrong as...

952
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,088
Move!

953
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:11,027
Kevin. Kevin.
I know you're out there.

954
01:07:11,052 --> 01:07:12,723
You think you've gotten away?

955
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:15,486
Well, what do we have here?

956
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:16,550
Hello.

957
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:18,089
- Oh, my goodness.
- Bob? Stuart?

958
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:20,534
Which one shall I kill first?

959
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,443
Little Bob.
Stuart?

960
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:26,668
Bob.
Stuart. Hmm.

961
01:07:26,693 --> 01:07:32,010
I will do it, Kevin,
if you're not back here by dawn.

962
01:07:32,035 --> 01:07:33,195
Oh my.

963
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,070
Huh, no!
I got to... my buddies.

964
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:38,054
Must find Scarlet.

965
01:07:52,037 --> 01:07:55,527
Eh-ha-ha...
There he is.

966
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:05,735
Follow me!

967
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:20,960
Harder.
It's just my head.

968
01:08:23,275 --> 01:08:27,136
- This way. Go get him!
- Go-go-go...!

Hello.

978
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:38,834
Huh.
My buddies.

979
01:09:41,294 --> 01:09:43,300
This is it, boys.

980
01:09:43,325 --> 01:09:45,539
Things do not
look good for you.

981
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:47,269
Oh.
And I'm keeping the bear.

982
01:09:47,294 --> 01:09:48,888
Huh.
Tim!

983
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:51,310
You're not going to need him
 where you're going.

984
01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:53,063
Heaven.

985
01:09:57,597 --> 01:09:59,419
Huh? 
Uh... Aah!

986
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:02,136
Shoosh, shoosh,
shoosh, shoosh! Oh!

987
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:11,782
Bye bye. Say bye bye, Bob.
Bye bye.

988
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:34,597
Ha-ha-ha...

989
01:10:39,883 --> 01:10:43,253
Ha ha ha.
Come on, no worries.

990
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:50,590
Oh, whoa!

991
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:53,625
Wait, what?
How did he?

992
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:55,320
Hold my bear.

993
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:17,271
Ha ha ha.
Safe.

994
01:11:19,336 --> 01:11:20,893
- Ha ha.
- Yippee.

995
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:22,109
- Kevin.
- Woo-hoo-hoo.

996
01:11:22,134 --> 01:11:24,273
- Be careful! Be careful!
- Be careful.

997
01:11:24,298 --> 01:11:25,809
So, that's your plan?

998
01:11:25,834 --> 01:11:30,241
Make yourself a bigger target?
Ha-ha-ha.

999
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:33,510
- One more scone.
- Yes yes.

1000
01:11:35,114 --> 01:11:37,041
Huh?
Kevin?

1001
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:39,768
Hey. It's Kevin.
Come on.

1002
01:11:42,358 --> 01:11:45,221
YAH!

1003
01:11:56,504 --> 01:11:58,258
Ha ha ha ha.

1004
01:12:03,947 --> 01:12:05,348
And so help me.

1005
01:12:05,373 --> 01:12:07,376
I never want to see
another one of your

1006
01:12:07,401 --> 01:12:09,464
goofy, bug-eyed
faces ever again!

1007
01:12:09,489 --> 01:12:10,537
Scarlet!
Scarlet!

1008
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:11,754
What?

1009
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:13,196
Scarlet!
Scarlet!

1010
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:16,111
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

1011
01:12:17,929 --> 01:12:20,142
Oh no, you don't.

1012
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,192
Yah!

1013
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:25,616
Whoa!
Wah!

1014
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:30,736
And just for the record,
my little deviled eggs.

1015
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:35,035
You can thank Kevin for
what I'm about to do to you!

1016
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,082
Aww!

1017
01:12:36,107 --> 01:12:36,886
Ow!

1018
01:12:36,911 --> 01:12:38,293
Oww!

1019
01:12:42,617 --> 01:12:44,510
- Yeh!
- Buddies!

1020
01:12:44,535 --> 01:12:45,977
Bob! 
Stuart!

1021
01:12:46,002 --> 01:12:47,417
Tony!
Hey hey.

1022
01:12:47,442 --> 01:12:49,666
Tom!
And Chris!

1023
01:12:49,691 --> 01:12:51,626
- Bodyguard!
- You're the man!

1024
01:12:51,651 --> 01:12:53,934
Ha ha ha.
Buddies!

1025
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:55,555
- Hey, Kevin!
- Good to see you.

1026
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,977
Yeah!

1027
01:13:06,162 --> 01:13:08,545
Ugh! 
Eww!

1028
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,462
Huh? Ah.
Kevin! Kevin!

1029
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,127
Enough!

1030
01:13:13,152 --> 01:13:18,315
This... ends... now...!

1031
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:45,078
KEVIN !!!

1032
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:48,977
Ha-ha-ha, you imbecile.
Have fun exploding.

1033
01:13:49,002 --> 01:13:50,926
Baby.

1034
01:13:50,951 --> 01:13:54,073
- What's the rush?
- Got to get out of here!

1035
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:58,253
Let... us... go!

1036
01:14:01,018 --> 01:14:05,038
Whoaaa!

1037
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:07,976
No, no no no...

1038
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:19,418
Ke-Ke-Ke
KEVIN!

1039
01:14:31,984 --> 01:14:33,433
Here.
Your Puchi.

1040
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:36,636
Huh. Puchi!
You're alright.

1041
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:01,888
Look!

1042
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:06,118
- Kevin!
- Kevin!

1043
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:24,972
Ha-ha! 
Whoo-hoo! Ah! Ah!

1044
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,555
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1045
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:29,944
- Woo hoo hoo!
- Yeah!

1046
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:32,685
Yoo hoo hoo.
Ouch.

1047
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:46,858
- Stuart.
- Hm.

1048
01:15:46,883 --> 01:15:48,965
- Bob.
- Yes?

1049
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:52,047
Okay.

1050
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,925
Ladies and gentlemen.

1051
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:13,515
We are here today
to celebrate the Minions.

1052
01:16:18,148 --> 01:16:22,301
The country owes you a
great debt of gratitude.

1053
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:28,185
Bob, you were a wise and
noble king for all of 8 hours.

1054
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,665
So for you,
I offer this tiny crown

1055
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,497
for your Teddy Bear, Tim.

1056
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:37,550
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you.

1057
01:16:37,575 --> 01:16:39,336
Oh.
Very good, Bob.

1058
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:43,131
Oh!
Oh, spectacular!

1059
01:16:43,156 --> 01:16:46,567
I'm so proud of you boys.

1060
01:16:46,592 --> 01:16:49,184
- Oh, Stuart.
- Ah. What's up.

1061
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:55,659
For you, I have this beautiful,
super duper incredible

1062
01:16:55,684 --> 01:16:57,590
snow globe.

1063
01:16:57,615 --> 01:16:59,556
Snow globe?

1064
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:01,081
And, look.
Look.

1065
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:03,498
Hours of excitement.

1066
01:17:03,523 --> 01:17:08,297
Oh... Yippee.
Thank you.

1067
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:14,224
Oh, Stuart.
We're just messing with you.

1068
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:17,319
Don't be mad at me.
It was Kevin’s idea.

1069
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:19,343
- Ha.
- Kevin!

1070
01:17:19,548 --> 01:17:22,549
We have a much
better surprise for you.

1071
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:24,980
Here.
A Super Mega Ukulele.

1072
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:27,896
Wo-Wow.
Cool.

1073
01:18:02,484 --> 01:18:04,133
Thank you.

1074
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,382
Right.
Uh.

1075
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:09,166
And finally, Kevin.

1076
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:11,312
Yes, my queen.

1077
01:18:11,337 --> 01:18:14,946
You are a hero 
of the highest order.

1078
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:19,922
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

1079
01:18:19,947 --> 01:18:23,870
From here on out,
you are Sir Kevin.

1080
01:18:24,206 --> 01:18:26,035
Well done.

1081
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:37,934
What a beautiful moment.

1082
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:40,046
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!

1083
01:18:40,071 --> 01:18:45,429
The nation, nay, the world was
celebrating Kevin, Stuart, and Bob.

1084
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,641
The last few thousand
years were rough,

1085
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:52,883
no question, but things were
finally going their way.

1086
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:56,691
Kevin had never been more proud.

1087
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:58,526
But something was missing.

1088
01:18:58,551 --> 01:19:02,183
Ha ha, yes.
Good show Good show.

1089
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:06,060
My crown is gone.
It's gone!

1090
01:19:06,085 --> 01:19:07,321
Blimey!

1091
01:19:07,346 --> 01:19:09,902
- She lost the crown.
- Oh my days.

1092
01:19:12,316 --> 01:19:13,854
Ha-ha-ha...

1093
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:15,884
Scarlet?
Someone stop her.

1094
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:17,862
Scarlet.
Hey!

1095
01:19:20,472 --> 01:19:22,080
They took everything from me.

1096
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:24,552
My castle.
My reputation.

1097
01:19:24,577 --> 01:19:27,250
Things looked bleak, baby,
I'm not going to lie.

1098
01:19:27,275 --> 01:19:31,774
But now, at least,
I have my crown!

1099
01:19:45,387 --> 01:19:48,186
Child, give me that back.

1100
01:19:48,211 --> 01:19:51,372
No, I don't think so.

1101
01:19:51,397 --> 01:19:54,758
You have no idea
who you are messing with.

1102
01:19:54,783 --> 01:19:58,325
I'm the greatest
super-villain of all time.

1103
01:19:58,775 --> 01:20:01,350
Oh, were you?

1104
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:10,973
Bud-Bud-Buddies.
Come here. Come here.

1105
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:13,191
Lo-Lo-Look!

1106
01:20:28,839 --> 01:20:31,939
It's the boss.
The boss! Come on!

1107
01:20:31,964 --> 01:20:34,477
Get back her...Are you
really going to allow that

1108
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:38,942
little penguin to make off 
with my crown?

1109
01:20:39,718 --> 01:20:44,073
Oh, Herb.
I'm done.

1110
01:20:44,098 --> 01:20:46,265
Hey. Hey.
Scarlet.

1111
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:47,549
Here.

1112
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:50,930
For Me?
Oh.

1113
01:20:50,955 --> 01:20:54,701
Yes, for you.
Bye bye.

1114
01:20:54,726 --> 01:20:56,863
Big boss!

1115
01:20:58,389 --> 01:21:02,898
And that is how the Minions
found their new boss.

1116
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:04,933
He was cunning.
He was evil.

1117
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:06,508
He was perfect.

1118
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,492
He was

1119
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:11,313
despicable.

1120
01:21:14,383 --> 01:21:19,468
Subtitle by <font color="#ffff00">- Aorion -</font>

1121
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:56,402
- Banana.

1122
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:00,532
- Banana.
- Banana.

1123
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:10,429
Banana.

1124
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,359
Hey.
Come on.

1125
01:22:44,246 --> 01:22:46,097
Shh.
Shh.

1126
01:22:53,852 --> 01:22:55,125
Cheese.

1127
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:58,057
Cheese.
Cheese.

1128
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:34,338
- Gru. Gru. Gru.
- It's Gru.

1129
01:23:41,426 --> 01:23:45,541
- Gru.
- Gru.

1130
01:28:42,576 --> 01:28:44,858
Bob.
Go play outside.

1131
01:28:52,143 --> 01:28:53,513
Want one?

1132
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,034
Hey! 
Come back here!

1133
01:30:44,085 --> 01:30:45,515
Freeze ray!
