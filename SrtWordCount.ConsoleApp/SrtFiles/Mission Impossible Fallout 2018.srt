1
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:40,251

2
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,251
I do.

3
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,424
No.

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,294
You should have killed me, Ethan.

5
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,515
Fate whispers to fighters ...

6
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,325
there was a storm coming.

7
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,463
And fighters whisper back ...

8
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,460
I'm the storm.

00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,229

HUNT, ETHAN M.

10
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,494
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

11
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,498
Solomon Lane the anarchist.

12
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,431
Ever since you caught him two years ago ...

13
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,343
his absence raises
an unexpected result.

14
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:31,247
Syndicate agents continue
create chaos around the world.

15
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,275
Dvisi Special Activity ClA ...

16
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,254
hunting down Lane's elite network.

17
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,381
But many are still
unknown and free.

18
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:43,292
The rest of her gang called herself
as '' Apostles. ''

19
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:49,400
They are wage terror, making them
a more serious threat.

20
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,467
They are the culprit of smallpox
in the Indian region of Kashmir ...

21
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:58,341
on the border of China and Pakistan,
threatening one-third of the world's population.

22
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,378
The plague has been dammed ...

23
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,313
But intelligence says there are new clients
renting Apostles ...

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,250
for a more ambitious operation.

25
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:12,287
They are contacted by extremists
with the code name John Lark ...

26
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,383
this doomsday designer ...

27
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,362
intend to destroy
the existing world order.

28
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,458
Lark is responsible

29
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,492
for the loss of nuclear experts
from Norway, Nils Delbruuk.

30
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,361
Dr. lizard Delbruuk revoked ...

31
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,341
after he expressed his views
about anti-religion.

32
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,436
Apostles communicate with
Eastern European criminal organization ...

33
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,382
which has three stolen plutonium nuclei
from a rocket base in eastern Russia.

34
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,319
This shows
John Lark and Apostles ...

35
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,348
work together to have
a functioning nuclear weapon.

36
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,262
According to N EST people with knowledge
Delbruuk, wearing existing materia ...

37
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,289
can complete three weapons
as fast as 72 hours.

38
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,334
This tool is portable and can be
sent to anywhere overnight.

39
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,466
In the hands of John Lark and Apostles,
this weapon will be a big threat ...

40
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,376
for millions of people.

41
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,404
Your mission, if you accept it ...

42
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:13,283
prevent Apostles from getting plutonium
by all means.

43
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,348
If you or another lMF member
caught or killed ...

44
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,426
The Minister will deny your action.

45
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,460
Good luck, Ethan.

46
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:25,260
This message will crumble in five seconds.

47
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,309
He's late.

48
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,381
- He's never too late.
- He will come.

49
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,315
I do not like it.

50
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,447
There's something out of this guy
which creeps.

51
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,354
Take it easy.

52
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,254
I'm calm.

53
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,318
It does not sound.
Luther, he sounds calm?

54
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,261
He sounded scared.

55
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,357
I am not afraid.
Just had a bad feeling.

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,391
You said you were calm.

57
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,496
It could be people feel
calm and anxious at the same time.

58
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,268
- Can not.
- You often do.

59
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,434
- No.
- Yes.

60
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,373
No.

61
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,277
I have to believe this moment
you feel calm ...

62
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,313
Benji.

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,442
in the dark alley to buy plutonium
from a psychopath?

64
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,508
Benji, I look after you.

65
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,345
Look, Benji? You're completely safe.

66
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,288
Easy for you to talk, you're in the car.

67
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,258
You want a field assignment.

68
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,317
Tonight I want in the car, Luther!

69
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,420
He's coming.

70
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,326
God.

71
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,311
Prepare the money, Luther.

72
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,281
Good.

73
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,379
Ethan, you hear?

74
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,479
Did you hear?

75
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,267
Are we going to do this or not?

76
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,277
I stay in this business
for the help of a voice in my head.

77
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,309
This voice is never wrong.
And every time you meet ...

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,250
this voice says the same thing.

79
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,445
What is that?

80
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,482
There is no.

81
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,428
I'm here to do business.
Have the voice throw a coin.

82
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,334
What is that?

83
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:20,464
It's a beryllium stick that reacts
with plutonium in the core.

84
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,439
All original.

85
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,214
The money?

86
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,380
The money.

87
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,417
Here comes the money.

88
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,497
Luther, bring the money here.

89
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,385
We need the money, Luther.

90
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,310
Kill them.

91
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,484
Let me take it!

92
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,356
Luther, you hear?

93
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,333
Luther!

94
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,265
Luther, answer.

95
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,236
Luther is not here.

96
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,262
What Apostles can do for you ...

97
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,338
Hunt?

98
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,309
-What do you want?
- You're stuck, Hunt.

99
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,369
Give her plutonium and go.

100
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,278
Benji, bring the car here.

101
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,282
- Can not.
- Benji.

102
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,511
Bring a car here.

103
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,535
Let's make a deal, Hunt.

104
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,469
Give him plutonium
and your friend we did not kill.

105
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,441
No, Ethan! Not for me!

106
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,492
I counted three.

107
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,300
One.

108
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,333
- Two.
- Luther ...

109
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,395
- Forgive me.
- Three.

110
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,285
Sorry. I do not know what else to do.

111
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,313
It is okay.

112
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,353
- You are okay?
- I should have died.

113
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,488
We should all die.

114
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,325
Why not?

115
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,495
Where is the plutonium?

116
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,279
Missing.

117
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,354
If you just joined ...

118
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:29,385
three big explosions happened together ...

119
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,295
which is a coordinated attack.

120
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,357
This is a live show from Rome,
overlooking the Vatican ...

121
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,198
and our camera is as close as possible.

122
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,400
The pope is believed to be inside the residence
when the explosion happened ...

123
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,401
We also live from Jerusalem
just outside his city.

124
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,243
Also from the holy city of Mecca ...

125
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,445
from USS Ronald Reagan on the Red Sea,
near offshore Saudi Arabia.

126
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,486
Radiation detected ...

127
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:01,215
shows nuclear weapons used
in this terrible attack.

128
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,285
Ethan ... it's time.

129
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,321
assuming news of casualties
which is suspected to be high.

130
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,458
Reportedly the weapon used ...

131
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:13,302
requires special knowledge
which few people have.

132
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:18,343
The question is who is attacking
these three sacred sites? And why?

133
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:23,245
Attacks occur at the same time,
an hour ago ...

134
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,509
at 04.00 Eastern Wakti.

135
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,549
A few minutes later,
Congress issued an emergency recess ...

136
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,246
and the Capotil Building was evacuated.

137
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,416
The president left Washington
with Air Force One.

138
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,257
The White House declared a state of emergency ...

139
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,387
and the military is on standby one.

140
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,329
Leave us.

141
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,460
Dr. Delbruuk.

142
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,438
We know who you are.

143
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,366
We read the manifesto,
we found your lab.

144
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,321
No peace
without great suffering.

145
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,289
'' The greater the suffering
the greater the peace. ''

146
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,360
This will bring them together.

147
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,355
As they read this manifesto,
they will understand.

148
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,457
No one will read the manifesto.

149
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,391
I guarantee.

150
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,270
What day is it?

151
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,495
How long am I here?

152
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,274
What did you last remember?

153
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm driving.

154
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,381
-There's bumped me.
- That was two weeks ago.

155
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,280
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

156
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,252
It's yours, is not it?

157
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,254
This is how Lark communicates with you.

158
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,450
- Lark?
- John Lark.

159
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,254
- We know all about him.
- You do not know anything.

160
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,455
There is information on this phone
to find it.

161
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,394
You got the code.

162
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,432
You think Lark is an enemy.

163
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,468
But you...

164
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,304
whoever you are, you are the enemy.

165
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,373
Because you're the system of survival.

166
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,469
- Why suffering goes on.
- Shut up!

167
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,505
We do not care about you.
We want Lark.

168
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,447
- Want to make a deal?
- No, Luther.

169
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,307
Exit.

170
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,247
Give me five minutes with her.

171
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,347
No. We can not do that.

172
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,414
Maybe we should consider that.

173
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,418
If they read the manifesto
on television?

174
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,326
- You can?
- With one call.

175
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,291
If he reads Lark manifesto ...

176
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,301
No.

177
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,234
I'll provide the password code.

178
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,404
Ethan! Ethan!

179
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,266
Think, Ethan. For the sake of many people.

180
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,368
Yes, think.

181
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,316
Sir.

182
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,284
He will not cooperate.

183
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,365
Right, sir.
If you read the manifesto ...

184
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,490
on television.

185
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,464
Sorry, Sir.

186
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,315
Global markets and trade plummeted.

187
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,479
Wait. Reportedly we will accept
additional information.

188
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,423
I just received the document
from Nils Delbruuk ...

189
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:25,259
a nuclear weapons expert who makes
weapons in this attack.

190
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,265
I was asked to read this manifesto.

191
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,266
'' There is no peace
without great suffering.

192
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,239
'' The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

193
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,244
'' People are captivated to destroy themselves
such as moths with candles ...

194
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,545
'' then the defenders of peace ...
Church, government, law ...

195
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,287
'' trying to save humans
of itself. ''

196
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,515
This will not help you now.

197
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,356
"But by preventing disaster,
they postpone peace ... ''

198
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,486
Rice has become porridge.

199
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,492
'' which can only be obtained through
baptism of fire.

200
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:04,231
'' The suffering that I carry is not
beginning of end. This is the beginning of each other ... ''

201
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,267
Can already be?

202
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,298
'' This is the first step towards
unity of man. ''

203
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,309
Could.

204
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,404
'' The peace I am carrying is
bridge to true peace. ''

205
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,279
Do it.

206
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,258
Could?
GuavaBerry

207
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,421
Certain.

208
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,429
I told you we will succeed.

209
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,340
I do not understand.

210
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,309
The attack did not happen?

211
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,506
Your car crash ...
that was an hour ago.

212
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,248
I hit you.

213
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,412
Just finished...

214
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,318
if we say finished.

215
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,310
AIR RANK OF RAMST ElN, J ERMAN

216
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,358
The phone you opened brought us
to servers in lsl ...

217
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,428
where we unveil communication
between John Lark and this woman:

218
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,432
Alana Mitsopolis, activist and philanthropist ...

219
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,341
dubbed White Widow
for his charity work.

220
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,471
It's just a pseudonym as
arms dealer, money laundering.

221
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,340
Extensive political connections
give him protection.

222
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:36,284
Lark and Widow meet tonight
to negotiate package shipments ...

223
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,222
which is suspected of our plutonium.

224
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,350
They will meet in a private space
in Grad Palais, Paris ...

225
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,295
during the annual fundraiser.
The details are in the file.

226
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:50,325
If until midnight Lark did not show up,
Widow will sell to the highest bidder.

227
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,427
So you have ...

228
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,529
two hours to find Lark.

229
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,298
There's something you have to know.

230
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,501
Just get there.

231
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,404
You have a tough choice in Berlin.

232
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,473
Plutonium or your regimen. You choose
your regulation, the world is in danger now.

233
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,317
Disadvantages in yourself ...

234
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,483
makes you can not choose
between one life and millions of lives.

235
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,250
To you it's a weakness.
To me, that's your greatest strength.

236
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,364
So I know you can count on me
to look after me.

237
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,390
Moving here from the ClA is a step
lateral, some say decline.

238
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,401
But I did ...

239
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,394
Because of you.

240
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,235
Do not make me regret it.

241
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,376
Call.

242
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,382
Turn off the engine.

243
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,270
-What are you doing, Erika?
- Maybe this is your mission ...

244
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,231
but this is a CIA plane.
Will not take off without my permission.

245
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,470
We need reliable information,
now.

246
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,447
This is where lMF exists!

247
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,416
lMF is Halloween, Alan.

248
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,344
A group of people wear rubber masks
ask for candy or dijahili.

249
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:20,390
If he keeps his plutonium
in Berlin, we're not going to discuss this.

250
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:24,259
- His team can die.
- Yes. Can be.

251
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,389
It's part of the job.

252
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,456
That's why I want my people to come ...

253
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,492
to assess the situation.

254
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,395
Agent Walker, Special Activist.

255
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,473
I've heard of his reputation.

256
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,305
You're wearing a scalpel.

257
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,502
I prefer a hammer.

258
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,341
My or ...

259
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,312
or no one left.

260
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,348
Do not get in the way
get the plutonium.

261
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,519
No Hunt, his team, or anyone else.

262
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,473
White Widow has spies
in every layer of government.

263
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,378
This aircraft is considered commercial so we are
can plunge into France undetected.

264
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,448
Widow meet Lark
in the midnight VlP room.

265
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,226
No one signed in without
electronic tape.

266
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,329
We have a number for RFLD for ribbon
Lark so we can find it ...

267
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,390
with this.

268
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,266
Find the tape,
You found Lark.

269
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,231
So what?

270
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,205
Then...

271
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,442
I use his identity ...

272
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,241
and meet Widow.
He brings us to the package.

273
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,245
People are deceived in this way?

274
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,418
What are your plans for Lark to work together?

275
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,322
I hit him in the crowd.

276
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:04,359
In 10 seconds, he's just as drunk with
others, confused and easily influenced.

277
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,490
After I borrowed his face,
You take him to the front door ...

278
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,396
and hand him over to Sloane's extraction team.

279
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,231
You can not get rid of me
Easy as that, Hunt.

280
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,396
That's not the point.

281
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,304
Of course that's the goal.

282
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,240
I know you do not want me to come.

283
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,400
But face it:

284
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,344
If you take a hard decision
in Berlin, I will not be here.

285
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,475
If you do not shoot every die
Syndicate agent you find ...

286
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,445
I will not be here.

287
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,316
Yes, I know all about you.

288
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,291
Because of you, there are no living witnesses
to recognize John Lark ...

289
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,451
or Apostles.

290
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,390
If you object to my way,
You may retreat.

291
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,525
'' Your mission, if you accept it. ''

292
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,270
I see, is not it?

293
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,339
Two minutes before decompression.

294
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,501
Get ready.
Widow meet Lark in 30 minutes.

295
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,225
Ten seconds before decompression.

296
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,425
Your oxygen is on?

297
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,463
There is no atmosphere at this altitude.
Do not faint.

298
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,468
The display has a guide system,
follow to the goal.

299
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,381
Open the parachute according to the cue of the system,
not before, let alone after ...

300
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,477
or the last thing crosses your mind
is your knee. Understand?

301
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,283
Very clear.

302
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,311
You need to think again.

303
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,441
- Move out.
- There's a storm. We need...

304
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,284
Simply talk. See you in Paris.

305
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,257
Come on, come on, come on.

306
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,299
Elevation: 7.5 Km.

307
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,348
Walker?

308
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:41,409
What's up, Hunt? You're afraid of a little lightning?

309
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,296
Elevation: 6 Km.

310
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,491
God damn it.

311
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,229
Walker?

312
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,393
Did you hear?

313
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,432
Walker?

314
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,437
Walker?

315
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,288
Come on.

316
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,517
Elevation: 4.5 Km.

317
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,284
Walker.

318
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,297
Walker!

319
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,367
Walker!

320
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,435
Walker!

321
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,446
Elevation: 3 Km.

322
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,274
2.7 Km.

323
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,378
Disastrous.

324
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,356
2.4 Km.

325
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,454
2.1 Km.

326
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,460
1.8 Km.

327
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,267
1.5 Km.

328
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,399
1.2 Km.

329
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,410
Walker!

330
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,300
Walker!

331
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,337
900 meters.

332
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,441
Open the parachute. Open the parachute.

333
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,315
Open the parachute.

334
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,321
Open the parachute.

335
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,426
God.

336
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,517
You lost your oxygen.

337
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,511
There Widow meets Lark.

338
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,284
Walker!

339
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,492
Tell me again! Where...

340
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,201
Ethan.

341
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,476
- In his man?
- No need.

342
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,509
Raise him up.

343
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,497
Do not be shy.
The more crowded the more exciting.

344
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,235
Come on, we're not rude.

345
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,267
- Can I join?
- We do not bite.

346
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,393
Shit.

347
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,288
- Can you still make a mask?
- Need a face to make a mask.

348
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,385
Sorry. I took aim at his chest.

349
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,288
- Why are you here?
-I am also glad to see you.

350
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,459
Sorry, I'm confused. You...?

351
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,300
Old friend.

352
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,343
Cancel extraction. Status blue code.

353
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,447
Send a cleaning team.

354
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,447
Northern men's room.

355
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,486
You did not answer me.
Why are you here?

356
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,225
Nice. Take it easy.
Look up until the bleeding stops.

357
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,294
What do you want?

358
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,306
Do you want me too?

359
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,468
You're not alone here.
Who sent you?

360
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,240
I can not say.

361
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,337
- What do you want?
- Dating with White Widow.

362
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,317
He's dating the Widow.
You do not look like him.

363
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,342
Hope they never meet.

364
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,446
- Hoping is not a strategy!
- You must be a new person.

365
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,391
No other choice.
White Widow is the only clue.

366
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,324
I must be this person
for five minutes.

367
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,453
- Do not do it.
-What?

368
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,296
What is wrong? What are you keeping secret?

369
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,425
You do not understand what it's involved in.

370
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,435
I do not understand what's involved.

371
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,266
I do not understand what involved?

372
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,464
What do I get involved with?

373
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,500
If you want to meet Widow,
he's gone in three minutes.

374
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,311
- Ethan!
-I will succeed.

375
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,248
- Ethan!
-I will succeed.

376
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,443
My name is Walker.

377
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,512
Oh, yes? Thank you again.

378
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,243
- What do you want?
- Come with you.

379
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,438
- Should not.
-There are people sent to kill Lark.

380
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:12,246
-I know.
- Not me. Rented. Assassin.

381
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,478
They do not know his face,
just know will meet Widow

382
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,387
They'll think you're Lark
and will kill you.

383
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,286
How do you know all this?

384
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,359
I can not say.

385
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,260
You should not come back.

386
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,496
You should come with me.

387
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,438
This charity begins to honor my mother.

388
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,350
For those who know him
understand its power ...

389
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,477
persistence, intelligence.

390
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:56,257
But there is another side of him
which many people do not know.

391
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,292
Part of his soul
which brings us all ...

392
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,490
gathered tonight.

393
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,298
Max is a paradox.
GuavaBerry

394
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,297
He is interested in paradoxical things ...

395
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,469
interest that I inherited.

396
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,374
Max had no idea
about our world today.

397
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,477
But he has a dream
will be a different future.

398
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,458
The future is no longer
requires his unique talent.

399
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,227
Everything he learned from the world ...

400
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,390
used to make
the world is getting better.

401
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,358
The future has not yet arrived.

402
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,238
Tonight, your contribution ...

403
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,400
bringing that future
a little closer.

404
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,313
Thank you for coming.

405
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,281
Enjoy the party.

406
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,396
You can not be John Lark.

407
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,374
It is not.

408
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,446
That's an alias.

409
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:29,351
That's better than John Doe.
Any other names you like?

410
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,253
Any place to talk?

411
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,382
I like '' Lark. ''
It sounds good.

412
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,482
Our time is little.

413
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,461
Honestly, with your reputation,
I expect people ...

414
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,286
which is worse.

415
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,299
Do not be fooled appearance.
I'm so bad.

416
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,429
And to be honest. You're in danger.

417
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,396
Do not touch him.

418
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,408
Quiet. He's my brother.

419
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,375
You're not polite
with our guest, Zola.

420
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,309
Time to go.

421
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,482
Do not make a fuss.

422
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,384
You do not want to be with this guy.

423
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,427
-What did you say?
- You're in danger.

424
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,331
- Who wants to kill me?
- First, Americans.

425
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,491
If that's true, I certainly will know.

426
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,362
Think you're the only one you have
spy in government?

427
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,239
Some people do not want to
this meeting took place.

428
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,330
Can not believe it?

429
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,401
Look around you.

430
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,342
I know your thoughts.

431
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,479
Maybe they're not after you.

432
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,515
Maybe just after me.

433
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,414
Are you ready to take that risk?

434
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,293
You have what I want.

435
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,494
Right now, only me can
get you out alive.

436
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,468
I want to go home now.

437
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,495
The French government accepts
assets of midday.

438
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,238
Tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock brought
to the Minister of Finance by air.

439
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,242
Armed police
will escort this route.

440
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,447
We make a diversion at this intersection.

441
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,342
Light will take
backup route here ...

442
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,512
where we take the assets.

443
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,254
Take his assets?

444
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,369
Assets.

445
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,400
We pay dearly for this information.

446
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,272
They give it all
except the person's name.

447
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,510
He's Solomon Lane.
An English Special Agent who became anarchist.

448
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:57,480
He collects the defector's agents
for a terror network called Sindikat.

449
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,417
Sabotage, murder,
mass slaughter.

450
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,419
They are very bad.

451
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,487
He was arrested by American agents
two years ago.

452
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,526
Since then, he has lived
endless interrogation ...

453
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,235
moved from the government
to other governments ...

454
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,240
to be responsible
for his crimes.

455
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,404
You look unhappy, Lark.

456
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,439
Maybe I'm not clear.

457
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,376
I went to Paris for plutonium.

458
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,420
There must be a misunderstanding.

459
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,480
I'm just an intermediary.

460
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,358
I connect buyers and sellers.

461
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,457
My seller does not want cash,
so if you want plutonium ...

462
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,489
Free Lane ...

463
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,331
and exchange it.

464
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,264
Correct.

465
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,504
Where do I know the seller got what I want?

466
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,296
Advance as a good faith.

467
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,301
The courier will send two more
in 48 hours ...

468
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,462
instead of him.

469
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,380
Good.

470
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,316
What happens after the redirect?

471
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,306
Kill it all?

472
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,374
- Is that your plan?
- No witnesses.

473
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,443
My aphrodisiac, Lane
will survive this plan?

474
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,386
He's in a steel car.

475
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,289
We get him out after it's safe.

476
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,383
You want plutonium ...

477
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,258
... this is the price ...

478
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,490
Or kill the police
past your limitations?

479
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,390
You're talking to John Lark.

480
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,337
I killed a woman
and children with smallpox.

481
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,335
I have no limits.

482
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,274
Good. Sleep well.

483
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,252
Tomorrow's a busy day.

484
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,304
Seriously.

485
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,310
If you want to free Lane ...

486
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,474
... here's how ...
-I want Lane to set him free,
Not Ethan Hunt.

487
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,347
I want a lark in exchange.

488
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,284
Not Ethan Hunt.

489
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,413
I want Lark to drive us
to plutonium ...

490
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,480
... and Aposiles ...

491
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,423
You might get your chance.

492
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,485
You lupajasad in the men's room,
at the Grand Palais?

493
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,463
I do not think it's Lark.

494
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:37,263
- Mungin Lark's men.
- Not according to our informants.

495
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,468
Whose information collected?

496
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,270
Hunt.

497
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:47,368
You've been suspicious for a long time
Lark is an American agent.

498
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:51,438
People who know our every move,
come and go like a ghost.

499
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,451
You mean Hunt is John Lark?

500
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,444
You set Walker.

501
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,253
You want to save your life.

502
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,519
It will not work.

503
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,255
Think.

504
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,230
What people are always careful about
as Lark is willing to take risks

505
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,253
like that?

506
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,391
Bethadapan with White Widow?

507
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,301
- He'll send a representative.
- Bait.

508
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,271
If he's smart ...

509
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,433
... he told his girlfriend
killing the bait ...

510
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,409
... in front of witness ...

511
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,343
I.

512
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,280
The scream is almost revealed.

513
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,249
Then he pays people to ...

514
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,341
... being Lark ...

515
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,443
... then kill him ...

516
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:32,285
And by pretending to serve the country ...

517
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,415
That's our secret identity.

518
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:38,394
- Free to operate, fully supported by the government
America.
- Why?

519
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,488
Why with Hunt?

520
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,457
Why did Lane and the Apostles defect?

521
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,227
They believe in a purpose.

522
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,502
When that goal turns out to be a lie.
They attacked their master.

523
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:59,279
How many times did the Hunt government,
betray him, deny it?

524
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,251
How many people like that ...

525
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:05,378
- ... finally feel sick?
- It's a charge ...

526
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,220
...serious...

527
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,425
Can you prove it?

528
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,266
I'm guessing the evidence you need
It is there.

529
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,425
Can Lane gas a village?
which contains 2 thousand people?

530
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,465
Yes.
- Yes he dropped the passenger plane ...

531
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,230
... for killing one person?

532
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,294
Yes.

533
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,432
- Is he really ...
- Hey. Walker.

534
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,432
Any story that makes you cringe ...

535
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,239
... maybe that's right ...

536
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,542
God.

537
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,419
You caught him, right?

538
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,315
How long do you think it lasts
he will keep your identity a secret?

539
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,497
We'll fix the problem later.

540
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,439
.

541
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,393
.

542
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,368
.

543
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,345
.

544
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,348
What did he do?

545
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,359
Come on!

546
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,297
Come on!

547
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,241
Hurry up.

548
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,333
Come on.

549
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,307
Hurry up!

550
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,449
Hunt? Where are you?

551
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,385
- Do not wait for me!
-What is wrong?

552
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,313
We meet in the garage.

553
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,295
Benji, you hear?

554
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,325
We heard, talk.

555
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,303
Change plan, I got caught.
Pick me up.

556
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,497
We're on our way.

557
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,253
Stop!
Stay where you are.

558
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:18,426
- Get in the car.
- Do not move.

559
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:22,455
Raise your hand.

560
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,233
- Go on, please ...
- Everyone, raise your hand.

561
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,342
Go.

562
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,379
Just go, please.

563
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,282
Just go.

564
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,380
Zola wants to talk to you.

565
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:55,329
- What about him?
- Kill him.

566
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,488
You'll be all right.

567
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,361
Take it easy.

568
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,424
(B ERBlkARA BAHASAASlNG)

569
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,301
(B ERBlkARA BAHASAASlNG)

570
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:35,495
We have to go.

571
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,399
Forgive me.
Come on.

572
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,344
My name is Walker.

573
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,345
Your little car?

574
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,453
God!
What was that?

575
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,505
- All out.
-Come on!

576
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,238
.

577
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,452
Come on!

578
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,451
Move out!

579
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,363
Come on!

580
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:13,354
That's llsa.

581
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,480
Shut up.

582
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,451
Interesting.

583
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,354
Glad to see you again, Ethan.

584
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,269
Oh, he's alive.

585
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,242
There is a microwave tracker
around his neck.

586
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,336
Understand. You know what to do.

587
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:13,280
I guarantee it does not hurt.

588
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,249
90 seconds ...

589
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,381
You and Apostles think us
will welcome you ...

590
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,220
... with plutonium ...

591
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,488
I want to say it will not happen.

592
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:27,485
'' Your mission if you accept it ''

593
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,399
Tell me, Ethan ....

594
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,433
You ever rejected it?

595
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,305
Ever asked who gave you
command, or why?

596
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:41,299
While you are getting closer ...

597
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,302
- ... ending the world ...
- Strange charges ...

598
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,372
- ... of a terrorist ...
- 60 seconds.

599
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:51,376
Terrorists are schoolgirls
who seek attention, try
forming public opinion through fear.

600
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,518
I do not care who that person is
think or feel.

601
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:59,290
According to my experience,
both did not last long.

602
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,522
And that justifies the plant bombing
or dropping ...

603
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,498
... aircraft ...
-Or bind me with a vest ...

604
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:06,501
- ... explosives ...
- It's an unfinished business ...

605
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:10,266
- ... my cute friend ...
- Luther?
- A little bit more.

606
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,367
You see the end as clearly as I am, Ethan.

607
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,277
The governments of the world go crazy,
syndicate...

608
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,372
... it is devoted to breaking down
they, brick by brick ...

609
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,350
Syndicates are herds
cowardly killer.

610
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,285
Syndicates are expectations
last civilization!

611
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:28,485
Opportunities to destroy
old world order.

612
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,425
Hope it's the same because you ...

613
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,360
... and your sad morals ...

614
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:38,356
You should kill me, Ethan.

615
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:44,330
The end you've always feared ...
will arrive.

616
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,267
Will arrive!

617
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:51,280
You will be responsible.

618
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,341
The destruction ...

619
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,320
... of all your good intentions ...

620
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,453
- Time has run out.
- Could.

621
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,286
Wake him up.

622
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,291
You're mine now.

623
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:48,460
You're full of surprises, Lark.

624
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,439
Your brother's plan is bad
from the beginning.

625
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,237
Your man can die.

626
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,334
And Lane could be shot dead.

627
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,244
I had to improvise.

628
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:02,247
- Why not say from scratch?
- Because I do not trust your man.

629
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,515
Especially your brother.

630
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,459
Family or how else?

631
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:15,321
So where is Lane?

632
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,324
- Definitely not in the Seine market.
-There's to me.

633
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,463
She's safe.
Where can I meet Victoria?

634
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,341
You're talking about that woman.

635
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,472
- Women?
- He's with you at the Palais.

636
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,413
Zola saw it again today.

637
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:36,215
He tried to kill Lane.
He had a chance to kill him,
but not taken.

638
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:37,514
Why?

639
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,290
We have history.

640
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,518
That's complicated.

641
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,265
I'll make it more complicated for you.

642
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,434
But my family has just gone up.

643
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,432
Somebody killed my parents,
I guess he was the culprit.

644
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:08,307
I want him, Lark.
You leave it to me.

645
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:12,410
Or you will not see the kirirnya
and plutonium is given to the highest bidder.

646
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,383
I do not want him to get in our way.

647
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,387
You'll get it.

648
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,300
At the meeting. Not before.

649
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,345
He went to London.

650
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,249
Receive instructions.

651
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,216
I know if you follow him,
you will appear.

652
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,422
You are okay?

653
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:34,295
- I do not want to hurt you.
-I know you have a reason.

654
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,363
I know.

655
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,436
Step back.

656
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,405
Can not.

657
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,264
You're not at the Palais to kill Lark.

658
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,509
- No.
- You want to protect her.

659
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,408
- Yes.
- You killed him to protect me.

660
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,444
You want Lark to free Lane.

661
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,325
No. You need him to free Lane.

662
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:08,261
Because you have to kill Lane.

663
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,356
Who told you to?

664
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,402
Ml6.

665
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,331
Why?

666
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,433
After we catch him in London ...

667
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,501
... they try to bring Lane home,
through diplomatic channels ...

668
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:25,412
Naum too many countries are looking for it.

669
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:30,282
That kind of person he saw
and know about the British intelligence.

670
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,255
... will not let them be taken away
to foreign governments ...

671
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:40,451
- Why did they send you?
- This is my way of proving my loyalty.

672
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,455
- This is my way to go home.
- But you're out.

673
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:48,459
- You're free.
- We're never free.

674
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,496
Two years I was disguised with Lane.

675
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:57,377
- For them, I'm also a threat like Lane.
-I have to kill him.

676
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,279
Or keep running away.

677
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,451
Tell her where.

678
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,255
I can not help you.

679
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,293
I will find it in any way.

680
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,355
Do not make me step over you.

681
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:16,355
- Yes?
- You're in London?

682
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,384
Ready to meet the courier?

683
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,262
Yes, where am I supposed to be?

684
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,232
Where to meet?

685
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,232
I pray this is not true.

686
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,365
To defend it, sir, if Ethan ....

687
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,400
- ... not intervention many people can die.
- Yes, Dunn, I'm sure ...

688
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:13,347
... the people of Paris are good and all over
France will take that into account ...

689
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,274
Then what happen?

690
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,330
... that's where we were told to London ...

691
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,501
- ... and wait for instructions ....
- And what happened?

692
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,274
Now...

693
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,304
... we meet the widow in 20 min ...

694
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:50,411
He drove us to the courier,
which will swap the plutionium with
Solomon Lane ...

695
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,252
Or, in our scenario ...

696
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:56,451
- Benji ...
-Affice.

697
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,326
-What did you say?
- Luther and I drove you to the messenger
Walker guarding Lane ....

698
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,456
- ...The original...
- No.

699
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:05,433
- Why me being Lane?
- Benji ...
- Our mission-my mission ...

700
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:10,268
... is to find the plutonium,
and I will do it any way.

701
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:14,368
- Despite having to hand Lane over.
- The original lane.

702
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:18,368
-I will not let him go.
- If the Apostles know you're cheating them ...

703
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:22,441
- You'll lose the plutionium again.
- Let us worry about Apostles.

704
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:27,251
- Currently, there is a bigger problem.
- Bigger problem?

705
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:34,227
- Ours? llsa Faust Lisa?
Why did he get involved?
- He ordered Ml6 to kill Lane.

706
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:37,289
Wait, he's in Paris?

707
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:41,393
- By motorcycle, Ethan he tried
kill us!
- Not us.

708
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:45,464
- He wants to kill Lane,
he has no choice.
- And He'll kill me.

709
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:49,238
- I will not let you.
- How to?

710
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,275
- I'm thinking.
- Oh, he's thinking.

711
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:56,479
- Our time is narrow, must be prepared
for this meeting.
- This meeting is a trap.

712
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:02,383
White Widow works with ClA.
From the beginning.

713
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,383
He did to keep his business safe.

714
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:08,419
Getting Plutonium,
Apostles, and John Lark ...

715
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,366
- ... he will be trusted by America ...
- But if Sloane knows this is a trap.

716
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,461
- why did not he say?
- Because in his mind, anyone can be
John Lark ...

717
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,438
... including one of our ...

718
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:21,408
Now his suspicions were proven.

719
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:27,314
According to the document, there is evidence of traces
electronics that hook Hunt ...

720
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:30,375
... with cache theft from CDC ...

721
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,321
Also associate it with recruitment ...

722
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:39,351
... Doctor Dellbruuk,
and Hunt herself who submitted the plutonium
to Apostles ...

723
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:43,229
Plus a long history about
defiant behavior ...

724
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,496
... corroborating the ClA statement ....

725
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:49,367
... that Hunt defected ...

726
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:54,332
And the search is just to hide
that Lark ...

727
01:16:55,344 --> 01:17:00,213
- ... is me ...
-I admit it, Ethan.

728
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:04,216
Usually the biggest enemy
is the only self ...

729
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,310
... an allegory ...

730
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:13,226
Sloane also had questions for him.

731
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,320
Widow offers llsa at no additional cost.

732
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:19,266
Where does Sloane get this information?

733
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:24,295
He did not say.
But he gave me a chance to take you ...

734
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,274
... come home from this mission I cancel ...

735
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:31,245
- ... and surrendered Solomon Lane.
- Do not do that, sir.
- Hunt.

736
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,272
-I know Lane, he has no intention of returning.
- That's why we bring him back.

737
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,309
That's what he wants us to do.

738
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,446
Sir, what do you think happens to be?

739
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:43,322
Someone accidentally found this?
Lane that sends to Sloane.

740
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:47,454
Lane knew what his reaction was, like
he knows Widow will hand us over,
understand?

741
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,430
Here, sir.

742
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,365
It's a trap.

743
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,336
- We are directed.
- Hunt! Still two plutonium cores ...

744
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,339
- ... not found!
- And you lost both!

745
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,233
In fact, sir.
We lost ...

746
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:05,269
- ... the plutonium.
- With respect, sir.

747
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,273
- You're not there.
- As your duty makes excuses for him?

748
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,486
Ethan, do not ...

749
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,421
... worsening circumstances,
I can not protect you anymore ...

750
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,424
...understand?

751
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,292
You can not pursue that plutonium anymore.

752
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,422
- Sir, you can not believe this.
-I'm given the opportunity to ...

753
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:24,432
... protect you or lMF, that's why ...

754
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,491
... I brought you home ...

755
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,401
If I refuse?

756
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,428
You think he's here for what?

757
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,431
Think you're a suitor?
He's a killer!

758
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:36,343
Closing number one Erika Slpane!

759
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,347
If you defected,
he is allowed to hunt you

760
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,346
... and kill you ...

761
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,479
That's my job, do not grudge.

762
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:51,415
Accept it, Ethan.
This time you lost, it's over.

763
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:54,257
No sir.

764
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,456
No.

765
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,261
I'm not asking you,
I give you orders.

766
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:01,235
The mission is canceled.

767
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,427
Now!

768
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,342
Stickett, he's your friend ...
Can talk to her ...

769
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:14,314
Sorry, Sir.
But you did not give me a choice.

770
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,443
15 minutes before meeting Widow,
Only us ....

771
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,478
... who can get his plutonium,

772
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,252
Are you coming or not?

773
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,489
- Come on.
-What are you doing?
- Benji must get ready.

774
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,362
- No, Ethan.
- No time.

775
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,264
Believe me.

776
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,406
You are okay?

777
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,248
Yes, I just ...

778
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,312
... have a bad feeling for this one ...

779
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,441
If no news from us ...

780
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:22,475
I use my way.

781
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,285
Keep watching him.

782
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,260
Simply playful.
I brought you out.

783
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,293
It is okay.

784
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,232
Just follow the instructions.

785
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:15,293
The real threat
already in our hands.

786
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,204
Is that so?

787
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:21,340
Do it.

788
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,489
Where's Lane?

789
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:41,289
First team on paralyzed send help.

790
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:45,417
Sir!

791
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,252
There's an injury!

792
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,392
Please!

793
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:02,501
Sir.

794
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,440
Ethan, I marked Walker, but he ran away.

795
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,248
You have to go after him.

796
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,349
Go.

797
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,291
I'm sorry, sir.

798
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,422
Go.

799
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,400
Ethan?
GuavaBerry

800
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:40,505
Wait!

801
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,476
Catch the bebedah.

802
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,245
Come on, come on, come on.

803
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,350
Yes! Could.

804
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,418
Sorry.

805
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:31,391
Tell me, Benji, Where's Walker?

806
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:34,231
About 400 meters west
if you turn right.

807
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,293
My Channel?

808
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,399
I can not.

809
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,306
Why?

810
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,306
Because you are followed.

811
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,279
You mean? By whom?

812
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,439
Where do I know? ClA, Aposties, what's the difference?

813
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:52,350
Exit from there then right.

814
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:02,223
Forgive me.

815
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,509
Why is he spinning around?

816
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:51,309
Cross the road on your left as soon as possible.

817
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,379
Ethan you hear? Go left now.

818
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,251
I do it again.

819
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,234
Now cross the road in front of you.

820
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,433
In the farther! You should be faster.

821
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:56,502
You caught up with him!

822
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:58,303
Straight.

823
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:01,475
Keep straight ahead?

824
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,484
Straight, straight, straight.

825
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:06,478
Now go right.

826
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,284
Right?

827
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,354
- Now?
- Yes right.

828
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,393
- Are you sure?
- Yes, me...

829
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,386
No, to the left, sorry the screen is locked.

830
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,430
Thanks.

831
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:36,347
- What are you waiting for?
-I jump from the window!

832
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:38,249
What do you mean to jump from ...

833
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,483
Sorry. but the picture is two dimensional.

834
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:43,415
Good luck.

835
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,222
At the end of the bridge to the left,
You almost caught up with him.

836
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:26,456
Come on, get him! You're on it!

837
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:45,250
He's in front of you! Catch him!

838
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:24,485
Can not, huh? Not before
You can plutonium.

839
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:28,454
No. He still has a plan for you.

840
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:32,456
You can surrender and
confess yourself John Lark ...

841
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:35,469
then watch the old world
explode from your little cell.

842
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:38,301
If you do not want to?

843
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,476
I'm his guardian angel, Hunt.

844
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:56,319
If I see you again, he dies.

845
01:29:56,357 --> 01:29:59,258
If you try to warn him, he dies.

846
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:01,462
Know when you lost.

847
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:14,434
This is the design we find from Dr.
Delburk in Berlin.

848
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:17,233
It's a five megaton nuclear bomb.

849
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:19,399
It's stronger than an explosive
during World War II.

850
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,308
To disarm our ordinary
cut the fuse cable here.

851
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,242
Usually?

852
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:29,375
Walker and Lane have two cores
pulutonium means two bombs.

853
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:33,419
Both are connected with siyal
the safety risks are very accurate.

854
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:37,452
If one bomb is disarmed,
other bombs will explode.

855
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:41,360
It means that once activated,
both bombs can not be stripped.

856
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:45,388
Countdown is enabled with
remot, which is also a safety.

857
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:48,334
It means that countdown in start ...

858
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,403
can not stop.

859
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,333
So what is the solution?

860
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,275
We're thinking.

861
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:03,476
... technically, it's a suicide mission.

862
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:16,287
What is wrong?

863
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,390
Sit down, please.

864
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,494
For years I've known Ethan ...

865
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:27,440
He is only serious with two women.

866
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,377
First his wife.

867
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:32,506
He is married?

868
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:34,413
It was.

869
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:37,250
Was it? What happened?

870
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,219
She was kidnapped ...

871
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,312
By someone who wants to harm Ethan.

872
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,415
Calm down, ethan managed to save him.

873
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:47,250
Then Ethan stopped.

874
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:49,422
They are happy for some time.

875
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,492
Namu every time there is a thing
bad happens in the world ...

876
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:55,468
Ethan thought I should be there.

877
01:32:55,503 --> 01:33:00,406
His wife thinks who's keeping it
Ethan's world watch over me?

878
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:04,335
Both of them know that one day ...

879
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:07,280
something very bad will happen ...

880
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:11,314
Because they are together.

881
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,447
So...

882
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:18,322
- Where is he now?
- He's hiding.

883
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:20,317
He is good at hiding.

884
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,295
I taught him.

885
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:26,355
Occasionally he sends a signal
so Ethan knows he's safe.

886
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,391
That makes Ethan power.

887
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,296
Why would you tell me this?

888
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:38,504
All messed up because of Ethan
do not let me die.

889
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,340
He's a good guy.

890
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,352
He cares about you

891
01:33:45,386 --> 01:33:48,253
More than he admits.

892
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:51,383
It's one more burden
can he bear this moment.

893
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:56,486
If you care about her ...

894
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:59,364
...Go.

895
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:03,428
No.

896
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,302
Everything is fine?

897
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:19,319
I am coming along.

898
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:29,456
I know.

899
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,525
How to find it?

900
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,261
Microwave transmitter.

901
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:41,240
Can be tracked with
satellites around the world.

902
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:43,436
Lane had one behind his neck.

903
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:45,445
We pull it out in paris.

904
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:47,471
And put our transmitter.

905
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:48,482
Could.

906
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:53,318
Activation in snooze 36 hours ...

907
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,221
Who knows Aposties is scanning Lane.

908
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:58,452
So you're planning on removing it.

909
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:01,256
Open this way, but yes.

910
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:02,455
He will sue us into plutonium.

911
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,396
Are you sure?

912
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:06,491
His plan to send me to jail failed.

913
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:10,294
I want to be present when the bomb explodes.

914
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:13,407
- When is this transmitter active?
-I found it.

915
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:16,239
He headed east over Europe at 500 Knots.

916
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:17,301
He's in the air.

917
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,278
Let's see the ClA?

918
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,304
ClA in susupi.

919
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:22,508
I can not believe anyone in this room.

920
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,411
We have to do it ourselves.

921
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:29,347
Where to go?

922
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:50,436
How, Benji?

923
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:54,246
If there is a way to disarm
bomb, I can not find it.

924
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:58,207
Shit. Ethan, the signal is gone.

925
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:00,243
Lane must have found our transmitter.

926
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:03,415
- Where's his last position?
- About 48 kilometers northeast.

927
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,289
He wants us to go there.

928
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:09,487
Anything in there? - River valley
Nubra. there is only one medical camp.

929
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:12,294
Humanitarian aid abroad.

930
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:15,268
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

931
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:17,270
Smallpox.

932
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:21,504
-What?
- Smallpox Apostieus triggers smallpox outbreak in Kashmir

933
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:25,239
Lane must have a reason
to keep the camp there.

934
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,337
But what?

935
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,406
-Affice
-What?

936
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:32,486
The Nubra River is at the base of the Siache glacier

937
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,385
The nuclear explosion there will irradiate ...

938
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:37,481
the largest natural irrigation system in the world.

939
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:42,420
Water seger from China border
to India and Pakistan.

940
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:46,399
They will make a third
the world population is starving.

941
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,231
The greater the suffering ...

942
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:50,362
The greater the peace.

943
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:52,531
I do not understand why Lane
want a medical camp there.

944
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,400
Not important.

945
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:57,239
The important thing to find a way
to disarm his bomb.

946
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:59,337
I think I found it.

947
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:01,246
Maybe.

948
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:03,341
It will definitely be in bomb operation

949
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:07,252
Detoantor far distance requires
the shooter's key.

950
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:10,451
If we take, sitemp engaman will die
and we can cut both fuses.

951
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:13,449
So one of us should get it
detonator and unplug it.

952
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,461
Yes.

953
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:18,226
Others cut
fuse on both bombs. Simple.

954
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:19,425
Yes, but ...

955
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,331
But what?

956
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:25,533
In order to succeed, we can not pull
the key or cut the fuse ...

957
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:28,337
Before the countdown starts.

958
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,503
Wait, let me be clear.

959
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:36,339
The only way to disarm his bomb ...
is to let the countdown start.

960
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,319
Then unplug it.

961
01:37:47,494 --> 01:37:49,257
OK.

962
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,449
Both bombs are now connected to the detonator.

963
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:15,312
15 minutes should be enough for you
to reach a safe distance.

964
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:20,324
My escape days ended.

965
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:23,296
Here is the end of my journey.

966
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:53,393
I can signal everywhere.

967
01:38:53,494 --> 01:38:57,225
We're in medical camp, X-ray machine, CAT

968
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,323
Radiological signals are everywhere.

969
01:38:59,366 --> 01:39:00,390
Like a needle in a haystack.

970
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,495
We check one by one. Come on
split up, do not turn off the radio.

971
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:16,312
Ethan?

972
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:22,514
Julia?

973
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:29,225
That ...?

974
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:34,301
Julia!

975
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:37,495
Does he know?

976
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:40,235
Hey.

977
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,265
This is my husband, Erik.

978
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:45,342
- It's ... - Rob. Dr. Thorne. Rob Thorne.

979
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:48,439
-I work with Julia
- At Massachusetts General Hospital.

980
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:50,477
- Before New York
- Seriously.

981
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:53,281
- It is such a coincidence
- Correct

982
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,346
-Are you coming here?
-I...

983
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:57,323
I'm in Turtuk, not far from here ...

984
01:39:57,324 --> 01:40:00,293
And I heard this place needs help.

985
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,419
Oh

986
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:05,455
We want to finish, the whole village
already inoculated. But...

987
01:40:06,367 --> 01:40:08,335
What are you doing in Turktuk?

988
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:10,435
Rob is on vacation.

989
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:13,304
No. I am working.

990
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:17,340
You're far from your house.

991
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:20,345
Yes, thanks to our guardian angel.

992
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:21,473
Protector?

993
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:25,383
We run field hospitals outside Darfur
the answer is here.

994
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:29,254
Then suddenly we can phone
of donors are unknown.

995
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:33,248
He wants to finance the whole
Option with one condition.

996
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:35,485
We process it.

997
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:38,225
You believe that?

998
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,297
Certain.

999
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,302
Yes, all of a sudden.

1000
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:43,496
Suddenly.

1001
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:47,432
That's great.

1002
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:50,238
Before meeting Julia me
never traveled.

1003
01:40:50,277 --> 01:40:51,471
Never left New York.

1004
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:56,245
Never leave the hospital.
All day. Not on vacation.

1005
01:40:56,283 --> 01:40:58,251
Ethan, I found something.

1006
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:01,254
I'll be head of body at age
50 heart attacks at age 55.

1007
01:41:01,288 --> 01:41:04,280
He assures you to release everything.

1008
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:06,484
Helping the needy.

1009
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:08,484
Since then we traveled ...

1010
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:10,429
And my life is so much fun.

1011
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:13,460
I'm happy too.

1012
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:16,301
Thanks.

1013
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:21,237
We have to go a lot to pack.

1014
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,334
Let me. You two are talking.

1015
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:25,242
No, I do not want to disturb.

1016
01:41:25,312 --> 01:41:27,303
Serious? You have to be here.

1017
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:29,338
I regret your arrival in vain ...

1018
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:34,216
Let's just say, we will pack ...

1019
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:38,256
and kai between you back to Turtuk
so you can chat in the car.

1020
01:41:38,325 --> 01:41:40,452
- Yes?
- You are so kind

1021
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:44,430
All right, until later.

1022
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:48,228
Nice to meet you.

1023
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:51,360
I'm sorry, Julia. Forgive me.

1024
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:14,418
Bring both helicopters

1025
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:17,454
No one else can go.

1026
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:27,204
Be careful, be careful.

1027
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:34,337
The bomb is active. But count
backward has not started yet.

1028
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:38,283
The signal is strong, it means the second bomb
and the detonator is not far away.

1029
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:41,287
About half a mile to get there.

1030
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:43,381
They're still here.

1031
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:46,483
Ltuher, take care of this, you two come with me.

1032
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:50,287
Certain. I can.

1033
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:53,324
Do not worry about Luther.

1034
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:28,392
Walker.

1035
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:32,368
{Active Bomb]

1036
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:35,341
Disastrous.

1037
01:43:35,342 --> 01:43:38,243
Ethan, countdown on
start We got 15 minutes.

1038
01:43:38,278 --> 01:43:39,336
Walker holds his detonator.

1039
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,348
Come on!

1040
01:43:51,491 --> 01:43:55,393
- We have to evacuate them
- No time.

1041
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:57,488
All of this valley will be destroyed in 15 minutes.

1042
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:03,332
Late!

1043
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:04,429
No.

1044
01:44:04,471 --> 01:44:06,371
I'll get the detonator.

1045
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:08,431
- How?
-I think.

1046
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:10,467
Find lane! find the second bomb!

1047
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:14,440
- What does he want?
- Better not see.

1048
01:44:49,483 --> 01:44:51,348
How is Luther?

1049
01:44:51,385 --> 01:44:54,445
- Trigger everywhere, my hand is not enough
- Just finish it

1050
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:58,447
- Where is ethan?
- He's chasing the detonator
- Where's the detonator?

1051
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:38,389
Luther.

1052
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:40,524
Julia, you do not have to be here.

1053
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,326
God.

1054
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:44,299
God.

1055
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:47,271
- This is what I suspect?
- Luther, tell him to leave.

1056
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:49,400
Where can he go?

1057
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:52,402
What can I do for you?

1058
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:56,373
In gear, pliers with red handles.

1059
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:59,385
- You are crazy?
- Just do your business, Benji

1060
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:01,284
This is my business!

1061
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:45,417
Benji, you hear?

1062
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,324
Ethan! Where are you?

1063
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:49,488
- In Helicopter chasing Walker
- Wait.

1064
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:52,498
- Why in the helicopter?
- Can you drive a helicopter?

1065
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:55,491
You say helicopter? Why are you in a helicopter?

1066
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:59,399
Anyway ... you found the second bomb?

1067
01:47:59,406 --> 01:48:03,274
Still in search, but a show
find it without a detonator.

1068
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:05,335
I know, I'll get it!

1069
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:07,403
If he's in another helicopter ...

1070
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:10,280
- How did you pick it up
- I'll think about it.

1071
