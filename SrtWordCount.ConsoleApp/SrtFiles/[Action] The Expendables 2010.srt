- Why?

352
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,768
I need more money for my son.

353
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,561
I want to send him to a better school.

354
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,064
- Did Yin Yang get a family?
- I have no idea.

355

You don't ask, I don't tell.

356
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,235
Anyway, the pay share stays the same.

357

That's the way it's gonna be.

358
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,032

is a guy named General Garza.

359

- What's the problem?
- Who gives a shit what the problem is?

360
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,829
We got enough problems
right here of our own.

361
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,957
We don't get rid of those first,
they're gonna get rid of us.

362
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,086
Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

363
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,256
- This morning.
- Yeah? What'd you talk about?

364
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,428
Avoidant personality disorder.

365
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,638
You think too much.

366
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:47,517
You know, Toll Road, you're a great guy,
a little fucked up, no doubt about it,

367
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,394
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

368
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,646
- Yeah.
- You're talking about my ear.

369
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,940
Come on. Don't start with the ear again.

370
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,233
- Not the ear story.
- The ear story, not again.

371
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,360
- We all know the ear story.
- We don't want to hear the ear story.

372
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,862
- We all know I wrestled in college.
- Right.

373
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:04,450
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

374
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,162
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

375
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,415
and forms cauliflower ears.

376
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,127
My college roommate used to bring up
my ear configuration all the time.

377
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,130
Parties, social events, you name it.

378
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,924
That didn't really bother me all that much
because he's usually bragging about

379
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,760
how my ears are a badge of courage.

380
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,972
- Made me a little less self-conscious.
- Of course it would.

381
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,723
But that was short-lived.

382
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,769
One morning, during spring break,
I hear him on the phone, bagging on me,

383
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,021
talking about my "queer ear."

384
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,650
You see something funny?

385
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,026
Sorry, go ahead.

386
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,614
So I realize I'd become the brunt of a joke
simply because I look a little bit different.

387
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,492
So I decided to educate my roommate

388
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,037
on the common decency that should be
afforded people who look a little different.

389
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,332
I smashed him upside his goddamn head!

of cauliflower all his own.

- Lt ain't easy being green.

are gonna head down to Vilena

395

to see if we should take the job.

546
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,064
I'm not sure what the Spanish is
for "disrespect."

Come on. Why don't you man up? Jesus!

548
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,527
She wasn't your type.

549
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,071
Why don't you just keep saying,
"She wasn't my type?"

550
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,490
So I could put a bullet in your bleak brain!

- Yeah, really.

An American came here.

571
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,142
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to.

682
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,548
BARNEY: Yeah.
Church hired us to take out the General,

683
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,593
but the real target's this guy,
James Munroe.

684
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,930
He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

685
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,599
went rogue and teamed up with the General

686
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,018
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves.

687
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,103
And that's a big cash loss.

688
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,148
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

689

or the Special Forces
to take out one of their own.

690
