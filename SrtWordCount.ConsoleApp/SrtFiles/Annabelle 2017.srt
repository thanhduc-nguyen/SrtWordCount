1
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:12,136

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,074

3
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:27,799
Find me

4
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,569
closer

5
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,676
Found you

6
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:05,110
Ah ha!

7
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,673
You think you could hide
from me, did you?

8
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,496
Did you read what it said?
It said found you.

9
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,810
- It didn't say tickle...
- Samuel. Bee.

10
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,476
That's enough.

11
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,393
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

12
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:21,835
You're sure?

13
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,023
Good.
Because now it's my turn!

14
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,986
- Dad, help!
- You need help?

15
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,891
Oh sure, I can
help tickle you.

16
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:32,246
I think the bottom of this feet
might be very ticklish.

17
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,249
Time for bed, Bee.

18
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:51,830
Thank you.

19
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:01,877
- I love you Mommy.
- I love you more.

20
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,760
Mommy?

21
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:18,145
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

22
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:48,836
- Mommy.
- Um-hm.

23
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:51,140
Can we play dollies
when we get home?

24
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:54,306
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up

25
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:57,711
- I can play dollies with you all afternoon.
- Sam.

26
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:58,619
Yes!

27
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,776
Sam.

28
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,722
Good morning, Sam.

29
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,101
- Good morning, Esther.
- Morning.

30
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:04,985
Hey there, busy Bee.

31
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,047
Sam, just wondering...

32
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:08,825
if you got that order
of mine ready yet?

33
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,255
I got customers coming
into my store everyday

34
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,968
asking about your dolls.

35
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:15,385
You can send your son
over tomorrow, Vic.

36
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,551
They're ready.

37
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,587
Well, hallelujah.

38
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,941
I guess prayers do
get answered, don't they?

39
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,938
They do.

40
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,428
Oh right... well, thank you so much.
You all have a good Sunday.

41
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:25,697
- You have a good day too.
- You have a lovely day.

42
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,136
In you get.

43
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:33,658
Damn it!

44
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,623
Language.

45
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,861
There's a car coming,
why don't I wave it down

46
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:43,290
and see if we can
get some help.

47
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,177
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

48
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:54,760
I'll get it.

49
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,058
BEE!

50
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,639
No!

51
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:15,994
ANNABELLE
CREATION

52
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:31,364
12 YEARS LATER

53
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:45,188
St. Eustace Home for Girls

54
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:49,288
B-L-U-E

55
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:51,793
Okay.
Pick a number.

56
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,148
Linda?

57
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,539
Um.

58
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,598
Four.

59
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:00,173
Okay.

60
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,543
You'll soon make new friends.

61
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,285
Do my now.

62
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:10,801
What's wrong?

63
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:14,543
I just wish you and me
were going to a new home

64
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,717
instead of a new orphanage.

65
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,528
Sweet Sue thinks too.

66
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,593
It would be nice
to have a home.

67
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,253
Yeah, but...
only if you're there.

68
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,782
I don't want to go
anywhere you're not.

69
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:34,319
So, let's swear.

70
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:37,707
If someone wants one of us,
they get both of us.

71
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:40,789
Okay.
I swear.

72
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:42,139
Good.

73
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,983
Me too.

74
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,503
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

75
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,122
What?

76
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,870
She looks just like you.

77
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:58,047
So, how much further
is it, father?

78
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:02,125
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You're worse than the children, sister.

79
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:07,276
The Mullins agreeing to take
us in was a gift from god.

80
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:10,624
What kind of person isn't
excited about getting a gift?

81
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,176
I should mention
don't be alarm if you...

82
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,865
don't see much of
Mrs Mullins at first.

83
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,373
She... has a condition.

84
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:22,826
You see, she was in
an accident years ago.

85
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,956
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

86
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:39,969
Janice.
You need help?

87
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,511
No, thanks.
I can manage.

88
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,475
Sister.

89
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:54,124
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak,

90
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,921
but she's getting stronger everyday.

91
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,702
She won't be a burden,
I promise you.

92
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,895
Um-hm.

93
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,550
Mr Mullins, why don't
you show the girls around?

94
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:07,307
I can unload their belongings.

95
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:09,747
We'll start inside.

96
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,729
Thank you, father.

97
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:23,536
Wow.
This is an amazing castle.

98
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,263
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

99
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:27,697
This is our new orphanage?

100
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,416
Which is fine if
we're never being adopted.

101
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,402
There's a TV.

102
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,697
The television no longer works,
the radio however does.

103
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:46,623
This goes on forever.

104
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,525
You're right. We're going to need
a map to find our way around.

105
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,755
Girls, this way.

106
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,915
As you can see, the dining room
is more than adequate

107
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,103
to accommodate all of us.

108
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:01,926
Wow.
What's in here?

109
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,765
Let's stay together.

110
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,730
Mrs Mullins and I stay in here.

111
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:17,655
Fell free to use the rest of the
downstairs as you see fit.

112
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,889
Your rooms are upstairs.

113
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,477
Mr Mullins.

114
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:25,447
Is there someway Janice and I
can maybe stay down here?

115
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,122
Me too.

116
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:28,856
I'll be fine.

117
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,943
I installed it years ago
for my wife.

118
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:49,970
Hasn't been used in ages,
it works fine.

119
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,156
Try it, Jan.

120
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,069
If you don't, I will.

121
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:02,574
Up is up

122
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,317
Down is down.

123
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:06,222
It won't work...

124
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:10,569
... unless you click the seat belt in.

125
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,770
Like this.

126
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:16,304
Simple.

127
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you.

128
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,679
I get to go next!

129
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,376
Wow.
Nice.

130
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,973
I guess this is ours.

131
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:51,379
Let's take that side.

132
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:53,604
Kate and Tierney can have these.

133
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,905
What about Linda and me?

134
00:14:56,311 --> 00:15:00,069
Relax, Janice. This is a big house,
there are other bedrooms.

135
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,079
Why can't Linda and me
have those over there?

136
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:05,729
Okay, but then,
where would Kate and Tierney sleep?

137
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:13,994
Wow.

138
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,658
This is neat.

139
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,118
I got this one.

140
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,529
Locked.

141
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:48,102
And it stays that way too.

142
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:59,656
Hey, Jan.
In here.

143
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:28,875
Hey.

144
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:32,267
You wanna bunk beds?

145
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,941
- Hey sister Charlotte, can we...
- Oh lord.

146
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:56,440
Please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people their heart attacks.

147
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:57,730
Sorry.

148
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,181
What is your emergency?

149
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:00,466
Can we go exploring?

150
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:02,478
Help father Massey with
your things first and then...

151
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:04,086
But Mr Mullins insist that we go.

152
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,347
- But that doesn't mean you don't have to...
- You know how father Massey is.

153
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:08,302
We'll only get in the way.

154
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,524
- Fine.
- She said okay!

155
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,656
But look out for one another.

156
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,936
You coming, Jan?

157
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,995
Maybe in a little while.

158
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,127
Well.

159
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,675
Maybe I'll stay too.

160
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,169
Because you feel sorry for me?

161
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,232
Well...

162
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:36,445
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

163
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,963
Okay.

164
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,380
See ya!

165
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:24,062
Dear lord.
Thank you for bringing us all together.

166
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,701
Bless this food for our use,

167
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,435
and us to thy service.

168
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:34,461
Fill our hearts with grateful praise.

169
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:38,699
And help us give you
glory each day through

170
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:43,388
Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

171
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:44,713
Amen.

172
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:58,056
If you'd excuse me.

173
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,404
Carol.

174
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,753
Keep to your own business.

175
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:59,703
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.

176
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,984
Please, god.
Help Linda and me find a good home

177
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,428
and keeps us together.

178
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:07,202
- So we finally be real sisters.
- With good loving parents.

179
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:09,795
That hate homework
as much as we do.

180
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,980
But, even if they don't,
that's okay too.

181
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,096
Amen.

182
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:06,344
Find me

183
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:44,941
in here

184
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,021
Nancy.

185
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,513
Carol.

186
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,373
Are you guys in here?

187
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:10,056
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

188
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:53,833
I bet this is where
Mr Mullins keeps his wife.

189
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:55,882
Does she really wear a mask?

190
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:58,145
Yeah, she look like a doll.

191
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,199
Mrs Mullins?

192
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:02,731
You down there?

193
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:03,981
Stop it.

194
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:06,723
I think he seems nice.

195
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,826
Why don't you go find Janice,
see what she's up to.

196
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:10,945
Why?

197
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,792
So you can talk about boys.

198
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,386
Well, do you want to
talk about boys?

199
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:18,289
Gross.
No.

200
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:19,798
I wanna play a game.

201
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,151
Okay.

202
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:22,660
Let's play hide and seek.

203
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:25,060
You go hide and
we'll come look for you.

204
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,426
Okay.

205
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:34,628
So, are we going to
look for her?

206
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,390
Maybe.

207
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:43,961
Bless you.

208
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,323
Thank you.

209
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:47,520
What are you doing?

210
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:50,845
I asked Mr Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom

211
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,179
and he graciously agreed.

212
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:55,043
Would you like to help?

213
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:58,790
What's wrong?

214
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:02,518
I have a sin to confess.

215
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:07,044
Forgive me, sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

216
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:10,762
-  It's been...
- At least 2 weeks.

217
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:14,334
... at least 2 weeks
since my last confession.

218
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:18,965
There's this room upstairs
I'm not suppose to go into.

219
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,705
But you did anyway.

220
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,895
How did you know?

221
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,273
Because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it.

222
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:30,715
Well, the door was already opened.

223
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:34,982
I don't know how because
Mr Mullins always keeps it locked.

224
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:37,867
When I went inside
there was this little doll.

225
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:40,097
- And it was really strange.
- Janice.

226
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,944
Weird things started to happen.

227
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:44,452
Janice, listen to yourself.

228
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:48,087
What do I always say?

229
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:52,291
A sin is a sin
no matter the context.

230
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:57,837
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

231
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:02,160
We only just got here and
they're doing a very generous thing

232
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:04,595
by allowing us
to stay with them.

233
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:08,979
If they decide to
no longer have us here

234
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:10,845
we'll all be split up.

235
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:14,567
So next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule,

236
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:19,274
think of how that could've affect
the other girls first.

237
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:22,634
Do you understand me?

238
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:24,588
Yes.
I'm sorry, sister, I wasn't thinking.

239
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:26,099
It's okay, love.

240
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:31,582
For your penance,
pray 1 Hail Mary

241
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:34,975
and unpack 3 of these boxes.

242
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:41,533
What are you guys doing?

243
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:44,381
Unpacking boxes.

244
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:45,933
Oh.

245
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,188
This place is so creepy.

246
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,369
What was that?

247
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,418
What was that?

248
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:05,619
How dare you!

249
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,247
Oh, Mr Scarecrow.

250
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,295
Oh.

251
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,746
Found you.

252
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,487
You're not very good at hiding.

253
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:37,159
Years of neglect have
affected the counter balance.

254
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:40,080
There.
That should keep the draft out.

255
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:41,555
Thank you.

256
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:52,479
Those taken in Romania.

257
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,797
At a convent of cloistered nuns.

258
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,606
They have little contact
with the outside world

259
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,479
but I became very close
to these three.

260
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:02,751
That's sister Maria.
That's sister Anna.

261
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:04,809
And that's sister Lucia.

262
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:08,003
Who's this?

263
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:09,525
!! Valak !!

264
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,697
I... don't know.
I don't think I even met her.

265
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,559
Is there anything else you need?

266
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:20,203
No.
Thank you.

267
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:25,644
Good night.

268
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,526
Good night.

269
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:34,525
Uuu.
I like him.

270
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:36,535
Which one would you marry?

271
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,227
Oh.
I don't know.

272
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:41,261
I guess I'll just have to date
all of them to find out.

273
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:43,456
This is Ira.

274
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:46,310
- His eye.
- He's very handsome.

275
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:14,793
Night time is when Mrs Mullins
gets her powers.

276
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:17,380
That's why she's in bed all day.
But at night...

277
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:19,376
she can go wherever she wants.

278
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:22,984
She needs to
so she can feed.

279
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,742
And if you look directly
at her you'll die.

280
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,884
And to get you to look,
she'll keep saying your name

281
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:32,659
over and over
till you can't stand it!

282
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:38,021
Nancy.
Nancy.

283
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:40,410
- Nancy...
- No. No.

284
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,688
Nancy.

285
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,116
Oh.

286
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,559
She's ready to feed.

287
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:06,043
Carol.
Carol.

288
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:07,094
Carol.

289
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,460
Hey, we're not suppose to be up.

290
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:10,752
- Well, you'll do it to.
- Hey.

291
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,044
Why isn't he answering her?

292
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,821
- It's her.
- Don't look at her.

293
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:56,044
No!

294
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:59,364
Please please please...

295
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:00,966
Please.

296
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,088
Please.

297
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,857
She's gone.

298
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,595
She's gone.

299
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:21,929
What's going on?

300
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:23,204
What on god's earth?

301
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:24,677
- Sister Charlotte.
- Mrs Mullins.

302
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:25,760
She was here.
We heard.

303
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:28,086
In this room,
she was sitting right over there.

304
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,349
Who?

305
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,093
Your wife apparently.

306
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:33,839
They said she was
just in here.

307
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,473
Oh, that's impossible.

308
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:38,615
My wife hasn't been
able to walk for years.

309
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,994
Girls.
Girls.

310
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:07,759
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

311
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:22,807
You okay, Nance?

312
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,598
Did you really see Mrs Mullins
in your room last night?

313
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:38,446
Yes.
We swear we were under the cover and...

314
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:40,487
Nancy.
Stop it.

315
00:41:40,512 --> 00:41:43,561
We just freaked ourselves out
last night, you know that.

316
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,348
Mrs Mullins?

317
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,783
Sister Charlotte.

318
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:06,979
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

319
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:08,574
Of course.

320
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,429
It's good to hear
some life again.

321
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:51,900
I've been cooped up here so long
I forgotten what that sounded like.

322
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:55,797
What a lovely picture.

323
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:57,842
She was taken from us

324
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,909
at an early age... unfortunately.

325
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:05,289
If you could turn away
for a moment, sister.

326
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:06,760
Yes, of course.

327
00:43:08,746 --> 00:43:11,920
I'm very sorry to hear
about your daughter.

328
00:43:14,147 --> 00:43:18,385
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven.

329
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,172
I wish that were true.

330
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:15,434
Oh my gosh.

331
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,802
You shouldn't be in here.

332
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:20,933
Well, neither should you.

333
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:34,112
Who's room is this anyways?

334
00:45:34,137 --> 00:45:36,052
The Mullins had a daughter.

335
00:45:36,077 --> 00:45:37,732
It was her's.

336
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:41,576
Had one?

337
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,141
I think she died.

338
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:49,432
And I think that was her
playing the music too.

339
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:56,609
Stop trying to scare me.

340
00:45:56,634 --> 00:45:58,524
I'm not.
It's the truth.

341
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:00,484
Then why are we in here.

342
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,443
- We should leave.
- No.

343
00:46:03,173 --> 00:46:04,273
Oh.

344
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,512
Linda.

345
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:19,343
What is it?

346
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:22,912
We shouldn't be in here.

347
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,146
Okay.

348
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,119
I'll leave in a minute.

349
00:46:29,144 --> 00:46:30,701
Well, I'm going.

350
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,235
Dear Diary, today I came home

351
00:47:39,747 --> 00:47:41,165
Who's doing that?

352
00:48:32,353 --> 00:48:33,651
Hi.

353
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:50,863
You're the Mullins' daughter...
aren't you?

354
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:55,550
What happened to you?

355
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,740
Will you help me?

356
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:02,471
What do you need?

357
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:08,295
YOUR SOUL!

358
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:30,861
Charlotte!

359
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:33,016
Sister Charlotte!

360
00:50:44,281 --> 00:50:45,489
No.

361
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,305
How do you feel?

362
00:52:50,454 --> 00:52:52,168
Give her some space.

363
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:57,871
Girls.

364
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,702
Janice is feeling
a little down right now.

365
00:53:00,727 --> 00:53:03,620
So, we need to do
what we can to support her.

366
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:06,828
Time I think
is all she needs.

367
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:10,252
She'll walk again, right?

368
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,871
We'll have to see.

369
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:16,013
You need sleep.

370
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:18,602
That's going to help you
with the healing.

371
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:21,487
I can't stay here, sister Charlotte.

372
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:24,183
We can't stay here.

373
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,874
We need to leave.

374
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:27,324
Leave.

375
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,057
And go where?

376
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,487
There isn't anywhere else
for us to go.

377
00:53:35,272 --> 00:53:38,110
I didn't fall down those stairs.

378
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:40,826
Something threw me.

379
00:53:41,361 --> 00:53:43,137
What do you mean?

380
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:47,559
You always say that

381
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,643
even though we can't see god
we can...

382
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:52,914
we can feel his presence.

383
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:54,934
Well...

384
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:59,329
in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

385
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:01,083
What kind?

386
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:07,174
An evil one.

387
00:54:07,308 --> 00:54:09,297
It's coming after me.

388
00:54:09,322 --> 00:54:10,740
Coming after my soul.

389
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:12,277
You soul.

390
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:14,378
Because I'm the weakest.

391
00:54:14,403 --> 00:54:16,128
No, darling.

392
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:17,742
Listen.

393
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,636
The devil preys on
those weak in faith,

394
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:23,084
not weak of flesh and bone.

395
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:26,925
You are as strong
as any of us, Janice.

396
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:29,813
Stronger.

397
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:48,840
You're quiet, Samuel.

398
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:52,125
I think it was a mistake...

399
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,950
to bring the girls here.

400
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,603
Why?

401
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,608
The girl ...

402
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,707
The girl who fell.

403
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:07,042
Maybe she didn't fall.

404
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:09,208
Maybe...

405
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:11,794
It was an accident.

406
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:14,361
That's all it was.

407
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,668
Accidents happen.

408
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:24,195
It's been quiet for 12 years.

409
00:55:25,863 --> 00:55:29,443
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

410
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,656
instead of frightening them away.

411
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,136
You'll be better soon.

412
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:41,138
I don't think so.

413
00:55:43,062 --> 00:55:44,778
Not this time.

414
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,046
But you have too.

415
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,819
You said we'll find
a new home.

416
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,237
No one is going to
want me now.

417
00:55:54,262 --> 00:55:56,329
I'll just be a burden.

418
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,131
But you swore we'll stay together.

419
00:56:00,678 --> 00:56:02,445
I take it back.

420
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:08,565
Maybe I won't get adopted.

421
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:14,406
You will.

422
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,179
You know why?

423
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:18,891
Because you're special.

424
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:25,314
You're going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere

425
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:28,004
and they're going to
spoil you so much.

426
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:30,436
You're going to have
so many dolls that...

427
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:32,770
you won't even be able to
name all of them.

428
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:34,427
Sure I can.

429
00:56:34,452 --> 00:56:36,117
Janice one.

430
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,522
Janice Two.
Janice Three.

431
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:43,432
Linda.
Time for bed.

432
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:48,115
Won't you come upstairs?

433
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:51,113
I don't want to sleep alone.

434
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,422
Here.

435
00:56:55,509 --> 00:56:57,176
Take Becca.

436
00:56:57,572 --> 00:56:59,179
This way,

437
00:56:59,998 --> 00:57:01,783
I'll always be with you.

438
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,140
Then, you should have Sweet Sue.

439
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:11,591
Thank you.

440
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:18,061
Remember before
all of this.

441
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:22,354
When we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night,

442
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:25,332
And ate all the chocolate
of the pantry.

443
00:57:25,377 --> 00:57:29,217
Father Massey was convinced
that we had mice.

444
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:34,860
Oh lord, please cleanse
my soul of my sins

445
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:37,521
and cleanse our house of...

446
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:39,746
- these mice.
- these mice.

447
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:48,702
Whatever happens

448
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:53,615
I was thinking always
all those things we did together.

449
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:57,952
Good night, Linda.

450
00:57:58,439 --> 00:58:00,102
Good night, Jan.

451
01:02:59,448 --> 01:03:02,085
A little sunlight will
do you some good.

452
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:05,299
I don't the sunlight can fix
what's wrong with me.

453
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,903
You mustn't give up hope.

454
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:12,955
Hope is a home onto itself.

455
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,876
Dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you.

456
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:20,082
What book of the bible
is that from?

457
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,899
The book of Charlotte.

458
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,238
But that doesn't
make it any less so.

459
01:03:28,928 --> 01:03:30,525
Are you okay here?

460
01:03:32,254 --> 01:03:34,409
The sunlight actually
feels kind of nice.

461
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,086
I told you.

462
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:15,304
Sister Charlotte?

463
01:04:21,785 --> 01:04:23,304
No, no, no!

464
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:26,344
GOD HELP ME!

465
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,957
Janice!

466
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:06,226
Janice!

467
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:09,929
What's going on?

468
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:14,487
I couldn't get out.

469
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,222
Are you okay?

470
01:06:20,136 --> 01:06:21,649
I'm fine.

471
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,570
I'm worry about Janice.

472
01:06:31,374 --> 01:06:33,444
A few nights ago
she wanted to leave.

473
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:34,965
Why she want to leave?

474
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,837
Probably because this place
is off the wall.

475
01:06:38,004 --> 01:06:41,495
She told me the Mullins's daughter
was coming for her.

476
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,896
The Mullins' had a daughter?

477
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:46,610
She died a long time ago.

478
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,273
So, she's seeing ghost?

479
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:52,707
Keep your voice down.

480
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,164
So, she's seeing ghost?

481
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,265
I guess.

482
01:06:57,743 --> 01:07:00,671
Well...
You guys saw something.

483
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,623
That wasn't a ghost.

484
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:05,027
Ghost can only be
of dead people.

485
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:08,160
How does that explain
what you saw?

486
01:07:08,337 --> 01:07:10,915
Unless it really was Mrs Mullins.

487
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:16,459
Or...
something was just trying to scare you.

488
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:19,970
You guys are doing a good job
with that on your own.

489
01:07:24,601 --> 01:07:28,836
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

490
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,213
I don't think so.

491
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:32,554
Of course you don't.

492
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,628
You'll know what I mean
when you're older.

493
01:07:34,921 --> 01:07:36,587
Now go get to bed.

494
01:08:11,573 --> 01:08:13,257
What are you waiting for?

495
01:08:13,513 --> 01:08:14,895
Nothing.

496
01:08:19,297 --> 01:08:20,754
You like it?

497
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:22,947
It's nice.

498
01:08:27,614 --> 01:08:29,654
It's not my finest work.

499
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,255
You seem troubled.

500
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:44,643
Maybe I can help.

501
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:47,871
I don't think so.

502
01:08:48,101 --> 01:08:51,336
Talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes...

503
01:08:52,285 --> 01:08:54,149
all the help we need.

504
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:56,706
Well.

505
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,540
It's Janice.

506
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,678
She's acting funny.

507
01:09:03,938 --> 01:09:05,584
Acting funny?

508
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:08,461
She says...

509
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,683
she's seen your daughter.

510
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:16,611
My daughter...

511
01:09:19,353 --> 01:09:22,417
has been dead for a
very very long time

512
01:09:24,843 --> 01:09:26,316
I know, but...

513
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:30,251
You see,
Janice went into her bedroom.

514
01:09:30,276 --> 01:09:31,444
She what?

515
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:35,171
She knows she wasn't suppose to
but...

516
01:09:35,196 --> 01:09:38,194
- she found this doll and...
- What doll?

517
01:09:38,998 --> 01:09:40,559
The one in the white dress.

518
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:42,164
That's impossible!

519
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:44,190
That doll was hidden away.

520
01:09:44,215 --> 01:09:46,102
She mustn't go near that doll!

521
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:47,644
You understand me?

522
01:11:01,755 --> 01:11:03,255
Found you

523
01:11:15,095 --> 01:11:17,575
Janice, I told you
not to use that room.

524
01:11:18,129 --> 01:11:24,024
Please don't take
my sunshine away...

525
01:12:01,778 --> 01:12:03,618
Ahhh!

526
01:12:03,956 --> 01:12:05,319
Stay here.

527
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:09,053
Mr Mullins.

528
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,958
Mr Mullins, are you okay?

529
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:37,700
Go get ready for bed, girls.

530
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,916
I need to speak to Mrs Mullins.

531
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,259
Linda.
What are you doing?

532
01:15:52,793 --> 01:15:54,108
This doll.

533
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,057
It's hurting Janice
and it killed Mr Mullins.

534
01:15:57,373 --> 01:15:59,017
I'm getting rid of it.

535
01:16:06,223 --> 01:16:08,063
Linda, let's go back.

536
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:24,338
Linda?

537
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,806
No!

538
01:16:51,066 --> 01:16:51,996
What is that?

539
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:53,899
Who cares!
Run!

540
01:17:03,695 --> 01:17:06,277
Janice. Janice.
I got rid of it.

541
01:17:06,302 --> 01:17:08,232
I got rid of the doll.

542
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:12,576
Janice.

543
01:17:12,635 --> 01:17:13,756
Janice.

544
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:15,864
- What's going on?
- Where is Janice?

545
01:17:15,889 --> 01:17:17,920
- I don't know.
- Go find her.

546
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:19,239
Hurry!

547
01:17:24,903 --> 01:17:26,061
What's going on?

548
01:17:26,086 --> 01:17:27,035
No!

549
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,138
No!
Get that thing away from me!

550
01:17:32,102 --> 01:17:33,389
It's back.

551
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:35,543
I know it was back.

552
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,176
What is it?

553
01:17:38,514 --> 01:17:39,776
Evil.

554
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,762
The devil itself.

555
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:45,374
What are you talking about?

556
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:50,131
After Samuel and I...
lost our daughter

557
01:17:50,609 --> 01:17:53,966
we prayed and promised
our devotion to

558
01:17:53,991 --> 01:17:56,322
whatever power that
would allow us to

559
01:17:56,433 --> 01:18:00,214
speak or see our
beloved girl again.

560
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:04,149
It started small,
the contact.

561
01:18:09,979 --> 01:18:11,552
But it was her.

562
01:18:12,131 --> 01:18:13,728
Our busy Bee.

563
01:18:14,117 --> 01:18:15,817
We know it was her.

564
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:20,192
She wanted permission
to move into the doll

565
01:18:20,217 --> 01:18:22,653
so she could be
with us forever.

566
01:18:33,866 --> 01:18:35,385
please

567
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:37,125
We said yes.

568
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:40,084
And that's when it became stronger.

569
01:18:43,142 --> 01:18:45,522
Soon we can actually see her.

570
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:49,629
Only in fleeting glimpses
but that was enough.

571
01:18:50,904 --> 01:18:52,823
Our beloved Bee.

572
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:54,710
Our darling.

573
01:18:55,033 --> 01:18:56,614
Annabelle?

574
01:19:04,798 --> 01:19:06,955
Even though I couldn't hold her.

575
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:10,939
It was comforting to start
the past activity again.

576
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:19,029
But we soon realised
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.

577
01:19:28,853 --> 01:19:34,402
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

578
01:19:35,099 --> 01:19:37,488
You make me happy ...

579
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,651
when skies are gray

580
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,656
You'll never know dear,

581
01:19:45,129 --> 01:19:47,546
how much I love you

582
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:53,942
Please don't take my sunshine away

583
01:20:21,491 --> 01:20:22,770
Esther?

584
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:24,924
Esther.

585
01:20:29,642 --> 01:20:32,049
My... eye...

586
01:20:37,551 --> 01:20:39,751
It was a demonic presence.

587
01:20:39,776 --> 01:20:42,412
And it was using our
Annabelle to manipulate us

588
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:45,121
into giving it soul
it couldn't have.

589
01:20:45,146 --> 01:20:47,048
It tried to take mine.

590
01:20:47,214 --> 01:20:49,890
Then Samuel reached out
to the church.

591
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:52,435
They saved my soul

592
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:55,688
but the evil was still
attached to that doll.

593
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:59,095
So we locked it away

594
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,300
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god.

595
01:21:46,538 --> 01:21:49,574
It was quiet
for all these year.

596
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:52,286
I thought the evil was contained.

597
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:56,877
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

598
01:21:57,272 --> 01:22:00,483
But we end up giving it
just what it wanted.

599
01:22:00,692 --> 01:22:05,332
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

600
01:22:05,357 --> 01:22:09,679
You make me happy
when skies are gray

601
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:14,070
- You'll never know dear,
- Janice.

602
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,404
how much I love you

603
01:22:16,783 --> 01:22:20,459
Please don't take my sunshine away

604
01:22:20,484 --> 01:22:22,019
She can walk.

605
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:24,434
It's just us, Janice.

606
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:27,988
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

607
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:36,427
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte!

608
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:37,770
It's-It's Janice.

609
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,563
- She's... She's...
- Look what she did!

610
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,357
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

611
01:22:41,382 --> 01:22:43,455
- And stay together.
- Okay.

612
01:22:48,507 --> 01:22:50,996
They're on their way.
Let get somewhere safe.

613
01:22:55,478 --> 01:22:56,830
What do we do?

614
01:22:56,855 --> 01:22:59,500
We can't just leave her here,
can we?

615
01:23:11,294 --> 01:23:12,854
Mrs Mullins?

616
01:23:15,465 --> 01:23:16,975
Mrs Mullins?

617
01:23:18,915 --> 01:23:20,502
Mrs Mullins?

618
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,026
Girls.

619
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,545
Let's go.
Now.

620
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:49,991
Forgive me, sister,
for I have sinned.

621
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,062
- Sister Charlotte!
- Run. Come on!

622
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:27,472
Linda!

623
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:31,845
Go, Tierney!
Get help!

624
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,543
Or...

625
01:24:34,213 --> 01:24:35,894
... you can help me.

626
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,701
The truck!

627
01:24:51,064 --> 01:24:52,940
Come on.
Come on.

628
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:57,104
Close the door! Close the door!
Come on!

629
01:24:57,129 --> 01:24:58,962
Go!
Go.

630
01:25:05,197 --> 01:25:07,117
No!
No!

631
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,085
Okay.

632
01:25:13,899 --> 01:25:15,450
No!

633
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,395
I'm trying!

634
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:28,651
Guys!

635
01:25:32,055 --> 01:25:34,378
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

636
01:25:35,076 --> 01:25:36,425
The scarecrow.

637
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:38,239
What scarecrow?

638
01:25:43,726 --> 01:25:44,953
Get out!

639
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,317
Come on!
Run!

640
01:26:11,769 --> 01:26:13,049
Carol?

641
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:24,505
Nancy, I can't Ge the door open.
Is it locked?

642
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:26,487
Can you get it from your side?

643
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:29,025
Girls.

644
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,499
Nancy?

645
01:28:02,858 --> 01:28:03,816
No.

646
01:28:03,841 --> 01:28:05,113
No.
No.

647
01:29:25,094 --> 01:29:27,756
Lord, help me.
Lord, help.

648
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:29,620
Help...

649
01:29:30,809 --> 01:29:32,193
Carol, it's me.

650
01:29:32,218 --> 01:29:33,659
It's just me.

651
01:29:34,273 --> 01:29:35,716
Now, come on.

652
01:31:47,272 --> 01:31:48,631
No.

653
01:32:00,927 --> 01:32:02,078
No!

654
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:05,550
No!

655
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,582
Sister Charlotte?

656
01:33:50,836 --> 01:33:53,949
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

657
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,180
She looks just like you.

658
01:34:38,532 --> 01:34:39,959
Linda?

659
01:34:41,402 --> 01:34:44,085
Where are you, Linda?

660
01:34:47,629 --> 01:34:49,135
Linda?

661
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:04,729
Linda, I'm coming?

662
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:30,866
Found you!

663
01:35:33,495 --> 01:35:35,755
You swore if I found a home
you'd come too.

664
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,207
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

665
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,912
You go straight to hell.

666
01:35:39,937 --> 01:35:41,089
 Janice!

667
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,249
Forgive me.

668
01:35:50,195 --> 01:35:51,397
No!

669
01:35:53,142 --> 01:35:54,645
Let me out!

670
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:56,270
Let me out!

671
01:35:56,894 --> 01:35:59,124
Let me out... !

672
01:36:40,556 --> 01:36:41,746
Go!

673
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,251
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

674
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:33,496
Anything?

675
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,506
I'm afraid not.

676
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:37,803
Still no sign of the girl.

677
01:38:38,013 --> 01:38:39,869
But at her age...

678
01:38:40,431 --> 01:38:42,261
how far could she'd gone?

679
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:46,238
Don't worry.

680
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,519
We'll find her.

681
01:38:55,581 --> 01:38:57,455
This house is blessed.

682
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,775
Whatever evil was here
is no longer.

683
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,112
But...

684
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:05,140
The doll.

685
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:08,191
It was a conduit
for the evil.

686
01:39:08,216 --> 01:39:10,416
That evil has moved on.

687
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:13,077
Now the doll
is just a doll.

688
01:39:13,196 --> 01:39:14,509
So...

689
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:17,370
... which one of you gets this?

690
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:44,670
How are you holding up?

691
01:39:46,992 --> 01:39:48,649
I'm okay.

692
01:39:51,456 --> 01:39:55,032
You know, that wasn't Janice back there.
That was...

693
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:58,148
... something else.

694
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,623
I know.

695
01:40:41,612 --> 01:40:43,437
ST. JOACHIM
ORPHANAGE

696
01:40:43,462 --> 01:40:45,792
Hi there.
Welcome.

697
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:47,860
Let's go right inside, shall we?

698
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:53,475
She mostly keeps to herself,
that can be a bit quite.

699
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,314
but she's a lovely girl.

700
01:40:55,339 --> 01:40:57,680
She's just been through a lot.

701
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:00,970
I think you will love her.

702
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,060
Hello.

703
01:41:05,457 --> 01:41:07,770
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

704
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,213
I want to introduce you to
Mr and Mrs Higgins.

705
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:18,375
And you must be...

706
01:41:18,486 --> 01:41:20,816
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle.

707
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:22,828
What a lovely name.

708
01:41:23,962 --> 01:41:25,838
We brought you a present.

709
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:31,240
I hope you like dolls.

710
01:41:59,858 --> 01:42:07,794
12 YEARS LATER

711
01:42:18,327 --> 01:42:20,066
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

712
01:42:20,091 --> 01:42:21,381
What is it?

713
01:42:21,526 --> 01:42:22,619
Stay here.

714
01:42:22,644 --> 01:42:24,087
No no no!
No, wait.

715
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:25,272
It's okay.
It's alright, sweetheart.

716
01:42:25,297 --> 01:42:26,613
I'm just going to
take a quick look.

717
01:42:26,638 --> 01:42:28,341
Call the police.

718
01:42:42,226 --> 01:42:44,689
- Annabelle?
- Hi, Mom.

719
01:43:07,436 --> 01:43:08,819
John.
