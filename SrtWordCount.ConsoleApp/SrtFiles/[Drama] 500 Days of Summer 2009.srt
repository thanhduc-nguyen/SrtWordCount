00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,295

00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,466

00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,218
(whistling continues)

7
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,155
NARRATOR:
This is a story of boy meets girl.

8
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,954
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,

9
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,749
grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy

10
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,585
until the day
he met "the one."

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:30,465
This belief stemmed from early exposure
to sad British pop music

12
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,009
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

13
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,553
DUSTIN HOFFMAN (on TV):
Elaine! Elaine!

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,013
NARRATOR:
The girl, Summer Finn

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,431
of Shinnecock, Michigan,

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,892
did not share this belief.

17
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,437
Since the disintegration
of her parents' marriage,

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,815
she'd only loved two things.

19
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,068
The first was
her long, dark hair.

20
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,071
The second was how easily
she could cut it off

21
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,031
and feel nothing.

22
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,410
Tom meets Summer on January 8th.

23
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,706
He knows almost immediately
she's who he's been searching for.

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,253
This is a story
of boy meets girl.

25
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,589
But you should know up front,

26
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,508
this is not a love story.

-(beeps)
-(buzzes)

47
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,390
We didn't know
who else to call.

48
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,767
It's Amanda Heller
all over again.

49
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,727
You did the right thing.

50
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,774
(sighs)
Now, where is he?

51
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,776
(plate shatters)

52
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,990
GIRL:
Thomas.

53
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,577
Rachel.
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,122
-I'm here to help you.
-Help me how?

55
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,332
First, put down the plate.

56
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,753
Drink this.

57
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,464
-What is that?
-Vodka.

58
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,342
Um, does Mom know
that you're here?

59
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,429
-'Cause it's probably past 10:00.
-(sighs) Don't worry about it.

60
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,932
Just start from the beginning,
and tell us what happened.

61
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,602
TOM:
Things were going so well.

62
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,992
Then what?

63
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,077
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

64
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,413
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

65
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,167
-Did she say why?
-I mean, this thing-- what are we doing?

66
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,544
I mean, is this normal?

67
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,464
Norm-- I-- I don't know. I don't care.
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?

68
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,299
-You're happy?
-You're not?

69
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,135
-All we do is argue.
-That is bullshit.

70
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,845
Maybe she was just
in a bad mood.

71
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,972
Yeah, maybe like
a-- a hormonal thing.

72
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,683
-P.M.S.?
-What do you know about P.M.S.?

73
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,103
-More than you, Tom.
-Then what happened?

74
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,230
This can't come as
a total surprise to you.

75
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,775
I mean, we've been
like Sid and Nancy for months now.

76
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,779
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy...
seven times with a kitchen knife.

77
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:07,867
I-- I mean, we have some disagreements,
but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.

78
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,079
No. I'm Sid.

79
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,247
Oh, so I'm Nancy?

80
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,047
Let's just eat,
and we'll talk about it later.

81
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,925
Mmm. That is good.

82
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,552
I'm really glad we did this.

83
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,596
I love these pancakes.

84
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,725
What?

85
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,145
Tom, don't go.
You're still my best friend!

86
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,982
-Jesus.
-You've broken up with girls before.

87
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,818
Yes.

88
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,611
And girls have broken up
with you before.

89
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,862
-This is different.
-Why?

90
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,072
'Cause it's Summer.

91
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,033
So you'll-- you'll
meet somebody new.

92
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,120
Point is, you're The best guy I know.
You'll get over her.

93
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,789
I think it's kind of like how they say.
There's, uh--

94
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,749
There's plenty of other
fish in the sea.

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,252
-TOM: No.
-They-- They say that.

96
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,212
Well, they're lying.

97
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,882
I don't want to
get over her.

98
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,678
I want to get her back.

99
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,430
McKENZIE:
Maybe playing it safe

100
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,140
is the wrong approach.

101
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,225
The nuclear family is dead,

102
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,853
and we need a new holiday
that recognizes that.

103
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,813
May 21st.

104
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,443
Other Mother's Day.

105
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,363
Thank you.

106
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,700
I'd say we've got some potential here.
What do you think, Hansen?

107
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,578
Could you write up some
prototypes for these?

108
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,456
Uh, Mr. Vance, there's a telephone call
for you on line three.

109
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,043
Oh. Thank you. Uh, everyone,
this is Summer, my new assistant.

110
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,421
Summer just moved here from--

111
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,923
-Michigan.
-Right. Michigan. Right.

112
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,426
Uh, Summer, everyone.

113
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,304
Everyone, Summer.
Excuse me. I have to take this.

114
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,516
It's nice to meet you all.

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,435
NARRATOR:
There's only two kinds

116
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,353
of people in the world.

117
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,355
There's women, and there's men.

118
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,735
Summer Finn was a woman.

119
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,614
Height, average.
Weight, average.

120
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,658
Shoe size,
slightly above average.

121
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,785
For all intents and purposes,

122
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,872
Summer Finn,
just another girl.

123
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,832
Except she wasn't.

124
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,627
To wit, in 1998,

125
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,421
Summer quoted a song by the Scottish band
Belle and Sebastian

126
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
in her high school yearbook.

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,218
"Color my life
with the chaos of trouble."

128
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,136
This spike in Michigan
sales of their album,

129
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,430
The Boy with the Arab Strap,

130
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,933
continues to puzzle
industry analysts.

131
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,020
Summer's employment at the Daily Freeze
during her sophomore year

132
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,815
coincided with an inexplicable
212% increase in revenue.

133
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,108
(dings)

134
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,319
Every apartment
Summer rented

135
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:53,157
was offered at an average rate
of 9.2% below market value.

136
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,701
And her round-trip
commute to work

137
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,372
averaged 18.4 double takes
per day.

138
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,291
It was a rare quality,
this "Summer effect."

139
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,170
Rare, and yet something
every postadolescent male has encountered

140
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,339
at least once in their lives.

141
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,468
For Tom Hansen to find it now
in a city of 400,000 offices,

142
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,014
91,000 commercial buildings
and 3.8 million people--

143
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,142
well, that could only
be explained by one thing:

144
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,144
fate.

145
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,984
McKENZIE:
Dude, I hear she's a bitch.

146
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,944
Really?

147
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,988
Yeah. Patel tried to talk to her
in the copy room.

148
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
She's totally not having it.

149
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,782
Maybe she was just in a hurry.

150
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,410
And maybe she's an uppity,
"better than everyone" superskank.

151
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,957
-Damn.
-I know. She's pretty hot.

152
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,167
That sucks.
Why is it pretty girls

153
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,503
think they can treat people
like crap and get away with it?

154
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,797
Centuries of reinforcement.

155
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,342
(scoffs)
You know what? Screw her. I don't care.

156
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,803
If she wants to
be that way, fine.

-Arthur, did you get a piece?
-Thanks.

176
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,245
Want one? Yeah.

177
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,666
-Want one?
-Mmm.

178
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,046
-Summer, right?
-Oh. Yeah.

179
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,674
-Smiths fan.
-Yeah. Tom.

180
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,259
Want some, uh, uh--

181
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,136
It's not champagne.
I don't know what it is.

182
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,096
Sure.

183
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,723
So, how's it goin'?

184
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,642
-Pretty good.
-You just moved here, right?

185
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,018
-Mm-hmm.
-When?

186
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,771
-Saturday.
-Oh, wow.

187
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,606
And, uh, what brought you?

188
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,902
Boredom mostly.

189
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,571
-Wanted to try something new and exciting.
-Mmm.

190
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,156
Well, clearly you've
come to the right place.

191
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,825
(chuckles)

192
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,410
(chuckles)

193
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,372
-So, have you worked here long?
-About three or four years.

194
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,667
Wow. You've...

195
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,836
-always wanted to write greeting cards?
-(chuckles)

196
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,921
No, I don't even
want to do it now.

197
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,257
Well, you should
do something else then.

198
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,510
Yeah. I studied to be
an architect, actually.

199
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,388
You did? That's cool.
What happened there?

200
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,725
It didn't work out.
(chuckles)

201
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,602
I needed a job,
and here we are.

202
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,354
You any good?

203
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,607
Well, um,
I wrote this one.

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,821
"Today you're a man.

205
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,865
Mazel tov
on your bar mitzvah."

206
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,659
-It's a big seller.
-I meant as an architect.

207
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,162
Yeah.

208
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,580
I doubt it.

209
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,667
Well, you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer.

210
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,420
Thank you. That was actually
my nickname in college.

211
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,380
They called me
"Perfectly Adequate" Hansen.

212
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,507
They used to call me
Anal Girl.

213
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,222
I was very neat
and organized.

214
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,687
-Well, I should get back, so--
-Uh--

215
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,647
All right.
See you later.

216
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,779
(whistling)

217
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,816
(paper crumples,
thuds in trash can)

218
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't know, man.
I think it's official.

219
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,907
I'm in love with Summer.

220
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,784
I love her smile.

221
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,662
I love her hair.
I love her knees.

222
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,331
I love this heart-shaped
birthmark she has on her neck.

223
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,001
I love the way she sometimes
licks her lips before she talks.

224
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,838
I love the sound of her laugh.

225
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
I love the way she looks
when she's sleeping.

226
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,967

♪ She's like the wind ♪

228
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,847
I love how I hear this song
every-- every time I think of her.

229
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,182
I love how she makes me feel.

230
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,434
Like--

231
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,354
Like anything's possible,
or like-- I don't know. Like--

232
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,649
Like life is worth it.

233
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,029
This is not good.

234
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,785
TOM:
She likes Magritte and Hopper.

235
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,246
And we talked about Bananafish
for like 20 minutes.

236
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,456
We're so compatible,
it's insane.

237
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,751
She's-- Well, she's not
like I thought at all. She's amazing.

238
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,462
-RACHEL: Oh, boy.
-What?

239
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,925
Just 'cause some cute girl likes the same
bizarro crap you do,

240
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,094
that doesn't make her
your soul mate, Tom.

241
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,722
-TV: Red team wins!
-What do you mean?

242
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,684
-TOM: It's off.
-What?

243
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,853
-Me and Summer.
-Was it ever on?

244
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,522
No, but it could have been,
in a world where good things happen to me.

245
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,107
Yeah, well, that's not
really where we live.

246
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,066
No.

247
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,068
-(video game sounds)
-Lucky.

248
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,821
(sighs)
So, what happened?

249
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,865
-All right. You ready?
-Yeah.

250
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,868
So there we are.
Nine more floors to ride, just me and her.

251
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,912
Hey, Summer.

252
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,747
Hi.

253
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,542
How was your weekend?

254
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,586
It was good.

255
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,421
Can you believe that shit?

256
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm sorry. What shit?

257
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,674
-I think I missed something.

258
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,427
-She said, "It was good."
Emphasis on the "good."

259
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,970
She basically said
she spent the weekend

260
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,056
having sex with some guy
she met at the gym.

261
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,433
Skank. Whatever.
I'm over it.

262
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,186
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-She's not interested in me.

263
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,271
There's really nothing
I can do about that.

264
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,649
-Just because she said, "It was good?"
-And some other things.

265
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,068
Like, did she say, uh,
"hey" instead of "hi"?

266
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,655
I mean, 'cause you know that that--
that means that she's a lesbian, right?

267
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,573
I gave her plenty of chances.

268
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,661
I'm going to the supply room.
Do you guys need anything?

269
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,663

you tried to fight the bartender,

292
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,703
and you threatened to
burn the place down.

-Me too.

331

-Tom's from New Jersey.
-Really?

332
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,027
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was 12.

333
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,946

after Springsteen.

Bruce.

-Why not?

-'Cause I don't want one.
-Come on. I don't believe that.

341
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,965

being free and independent?

I just don't feel comfortable
being anyone's girlfriend.

345
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,850
I don't actually feel comfortable
being anyone's anything, you know.

346
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,186
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Really?

347
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,313
-Nope.
-(chuckles)

348
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,481
Okay. Let me
break it down for you.

349
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,777
-Break it down.
-Okay. I like being on my own.

350
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,739
Relationships are messy,
and people's feelings get hurt.

351
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,158
Who needs it?
We're young.

352
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,619
We live in one of
the most beautiful cities in the world.

353
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,913
Might as well have fun
while we can and...

354
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,373
save the serious stuff
for later.

355
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,169
Holy shit. You're a dude.
She's a dude.

356
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,797
Okay. But wait, wait.
What happens if you fall in love?

357
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,925
-(chuckles)
-What?

358
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,260
Well, you don't
believe that, do you?

359
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,721
It's love.
It's not Santa Claus.

360
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,848
Well, what does
that word even mean?

361
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,018
I've been in relationships,
and I don't think I've ever seen it.

362
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:28,977
Well, maybe that's--

363
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,104
And most marriages
end in divorce these days.

364
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,482
-Like my parents.
-Okay. Mine too, but--

365
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,151
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

366
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,613
The lady dothn't.

367
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,658
There's no such thing
as love. It's fantasy.

368
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,160
Well, I think you're wrong.

369
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,748
Okay. Well,

370
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,334
what is it that
I'm missing then?

371
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,588
I think you know it
when you feel it.

372
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,386
I guess we can just
agree to disagree.

373
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,140
Yeah.

374
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,768
-(slams table)
-Okay. Who's singing next?

375
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,688
I nominate
Young Werther here.

376
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,982
-I'm not nearly drunk enough to--

00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,610
-You were amazing.
-TOM: I know, buddy.

404
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,612
-You're amazing.
-(chuckles)

405
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,655
-This was so much fun.
-TOM: Yeah.

406
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,908
You guys are so much--
Wait! Wait! Hey.

407
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,327
-What's up?
-Not you.

408
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,371
-You.
-(chuckles)

409
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,206
-He likes you.
-Okay.

410
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,208
-He likes likes you!
-Good night, McKenzie.

411
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,293
-Why don't you just tell her, Tom?
-Yeah.

412
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,088
-You guys are the best!
-Sorry you had to see that. He's--

413
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,340
Happens every time we come here.
He, uh-- I don't know.

414
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,258
Something about that guy and singing.
(chuckles)

415
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,427
-Is that true?
-Yeah, yeah.

416
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,430
He drinks, and he sings
and just loses his shit.

417
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,641
No, uh, not McKenzie.

418
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,684
Um, the other thing.

419
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,436
What thing?

420
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,648
Do you... like me?

421
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,195
(laughs)
Yeah.

422
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,863
Yeah, of course
I like you.

423
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,033
As friends?

424
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,245
Right. As friends.

425
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,164
Just as friends?

426
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,710
Yeah. I mean, I-- I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about, um--

427
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,088
Yes. Why?

428
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,382
No reason. I just--

429
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,054
I think you're interesting,
and I'd like for us to be friends.

430
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,140
Is that all right?

431
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,103
Yeah. It's, um--

432
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,106
-Yeah. You and me. We should be friends.
-Mmm.

433
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,358
Okay. Good.

434
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,162
Well, I'm that way, so--

435
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,208
-Okay. Well, good night.
-Good night.

436
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,229
-Hey.
-Hi.

437
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,116
(machines beeping)

438
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,622
(whirring)

439
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,676
So, that was fun
the other night.

440
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,864
(copier whirs, stops)

441
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,296
(knocking)

442
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,174
(knocking continues)

443
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,884
-You son of a bitch.
-Shh!

444
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,844
The same girl you've been
obsessing over for weeks now?

445
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,804
I've not been obsessing.

446
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,389
The girl you said was
way out of your league,

447
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,391
that you'd never have a chance
with in a million years.

448
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,475
-That girl.
-Paul, seriously.

449
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,643
-Did you bang her?
-No.

450
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,521
-What, hum job? Hand job?
-No. Man, no.

451
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:08,942
No jobs. I'm still unemployed.
We-- We kissed.

452
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,820
Level with me, man. Come on.
This is your best friend, huh?

453
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,071
Your best friend who tolerated

454
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,990
you whining about this girl
for weeks on end.

455
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,575
-Paul--
-You were essentially stalking her!

456
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,451
-Paul! Shh!
-(door opening)

457
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,162
(man singing on stereo)

458
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,000
-Hi.
-Hey.

459
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,460
-I'm Summer.
-Summer.

460
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,630
-I'm Paul.
-Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.

461
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,680
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta do some, you know.

462
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,558
-Yeah, man.
-Um, pretend I was never here.

463
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,477
Oh, wait! Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Um, if any jobs come up--

464
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,896
Thanks, Paul! See ya!

465
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,691
(door opens, closes)

466
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:54,571
He's, uh, you know,
an old friend.

467
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,948
If you heard
any of, um--

468
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,409
Heard what?
Nothing. Really. You wanna go?

469
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,911
Yeah. I'm stalking.
I mean, I'm starving.

470
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,918
-(chattering)
-TOM: Ah, hon?

471
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,795
Our sink is broken.

472
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,511
Man, all of our sinks
are broken.

473
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,854
TOM:
What are we looking for again?

474
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,273
-Uh, trivets.
-How 'bout a flygel?

475
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,525
(chuckles)
No, I don't think so.

476
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,320
No? You don't want a flygel?
(chuckling)

477
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,405
(sighs)
Home sweet home.

478
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,536
Our place really
is lovely, isn't it?

479
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,622
Yes.

480
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,666
Ooh! Idol's on.

481
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,801
-(chuckles)
-The TV's not working.

482
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,178
Oh.

483
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,932
Well, I'm famished.

484
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,725
Let's eat.

485
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,191
Mmm. Smells delicious.

486
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:17,028
Oh, honey, that's because
it is delicious.

487
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,365
I made it myself.

488
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,701
-Bald eagle.
-Your favorite.

489
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,036
-Mm-hmm.
-(chuckling)

490
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,919
The sink's broken.

491
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,963
Well, that's okay,
because...

492
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,718
that's why we bought
a home with two kitchens.

493
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,178
You're so smart.

494
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,597

Darling, I don't know
how to tell you this,

501
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,500
but... there's a Chinese family
in our bathroom.

00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,650
Thanks.

507
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,324
Hey, um,

508
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,619
I just wanna
tell you that, um,

509
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,789
I'm not... really looking

510
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,375
for anything... serious.

511
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,881
Is that okay?

512
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,841
Yeah.

513
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,638
'Cause some people
kind of freak out when they hear that.

514
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,139
No, not me.

515
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,934
You sure?

516
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:16,147
Yeah. Like, casual.
Right? Take it slow.

517
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,233
(mouths)
Yeah.

518
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,235
No pressure.

519
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,865
(sighs)

520
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,937
(whispers)
Can you, uh-- Can you wait one second?

521
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,736
(door opens, closes)

522
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,365
Okay. Settle. Just a girl.

523
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,534
Just a girl.

524
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,287
She wants to
keep it casual,

525
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,414
which is why she's
in my bed right now.

526
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,333
But that's casual.
That's what casual people do.

527
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,212
That's fine.
That's great.

528
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,596

get her back yet or what?

00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,207
-Hey, maybe you should write a book.
-What?

577
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,127
Well, you know, Henry Miller
said the best way to get over a woman

578
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,254
is to turn her
into literature.

579
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,049
Well, that guy had
a lot more sex than me.

So great to hear from you.

I can't this week,
but maybe next?

584
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,686
I hope this means
you're ready to be friends.

00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,289
Yeah, that's it.
That is it.

00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,000
Your girl is losing it.

589
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,377
TOM: Can you just be serious,
for just a second?

590
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,755
-I am being totally serious.
-No, you're joking around.

591
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,591
-No, I am not joking around.
-"Octopus's Garden"?

592
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,135
Yes, "Octopus's Garden"
is the best Beatles song ever recorded.

593
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,012
Why don't you
just say "Piggies"?

594
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,264
Come on.
I love Ringo Starr!

595
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,684
-Nobody loves Ringo Starr.
-That's what I love about him.

596
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,980
No, no.
(giggling)

597
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,277

Ooh, this looks good.

598
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,738

That looks pretty doable.

00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,831
SUMMER:
Why are you asking me now?

602
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,374

Because this was your idea.

00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,224
How come?
(chuckles)

619
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,227
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain, I guess.

620
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,105
Well, try.

621
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,983
Um-- Well, okay.

622
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,862
Like, that building--
that's, uh--

623
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,823
That's been there
since 1911.

624
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,826
And that-- that's the Continental.
That's L.A.'s first skyscraper.

625
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,245
It was built in 1904.

626
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,039
What is that?

627
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,249
That?

628
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,419
That's a parking lot.
Oh!

629
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,756
Yeah. That's--
That's also a parking lot.

630
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,718
That's, um-- Yeah.

631
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,137
There-There's a lot of beautiful
stuff here too though.

632
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,394
I don't know. I just...
wish people would notice it more.

633
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,398
If it were me,
then, uh--

634
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,943
If it were you what?

635
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,820
I don't know. I think
I'd... make 'em notice.

636
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,157
How would you
make them notice?

637
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,247
I don't know. I mean, there's a lot
of different stuff you could do.

638
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,373
Show me.

639
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,126
Please. I don't know
anything about architecture.

640
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,878
(laughing)

641
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,673
-You want me to draw you something?
-Yeah.

642
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,926
-I don't have any paper.
-Well, use my arm.

643
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,389
Please, I need a tattoo.

644
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,767
-Well, let's see your arm.
-That's the spirit.

645
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,607
Well, the buildings need
to be integrated better, so--

646
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,360
You could maximize
light capacity here.

647
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,886
It's kind of messy.

648
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,888
That's okay.

649
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,561
(sets keys down)

650
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:44,155
NARRATOR: For Tom Hansen, this was
the night where everything changed.

651
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,575
That wall Summer
so often hid behind--

652
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,995
the wall of distance,
of space, of casual--

653
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,249
that wall
was slowly coming down.

654
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,378
For here was Tom,
in her world,

655
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,799
a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.

656
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,052
And here was Summer,
wanting him there.

657
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,971
Him, no one else.

658
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,307
-SUMMER: Have you ever been in a tornado?
-TOM: No.

659
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,019
-(Summer chuckling)
-TOM: It's that and my teeth falling out.

660
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,146
-SUMMER: I have that too!
-TOM: You do?

661
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,566
SUMMER: Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

662
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,277
TOM: (chuckles)
What else do you have?

663
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,446
Um, earthquakes?

664
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,740
-Really?
-No.

665
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,743
(laughing)

666
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:35,664
SUMMER: You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.

667
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,584
It starts out like I'm running
really, really fast.

668
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,711
I'm, like, superhuman.

669
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,215
And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.

670
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,674
And then I'm running so fast

671
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,052
that my feet
aren't even touching the ground.

672
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:52,431
And I'm floating, and it's like this
amazing, amazing realness.

673
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,352
I'm free, and I'm safe.

674
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,313
Then I realize,

675
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,941
I'm completely alone.

676
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,530
And then I wake up.

677
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,657
NARRATOR:
As he listened, Tom began to realize

678
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,285
that these weren't stories
routinely told.

679
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,622
-These were stories one had to earn.
-(continues, faint)

680
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,750
He could feel the wall
coming down.

681
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,170
He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

682
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,174
Which is why the next six words
changed everything.

683
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,010
I've never told anybody
that before.

684
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,392
I guess I'm not just anybody.

685
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,894
-(video game beeping)
-So what are you exactly?

686
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,980
-I don't know.
-Are you her boyfriend?

687
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,315
-It's not that simple.
-Sure, it is.

688
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,568
What, like, are we going steady?
Come on, guys.

689
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,154
You know, we're-- we're adults.
We know how we feel.

690
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,239
We don't need
to put labels on it.

691
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,283
I mean, "boyfriend,"
"girlfriend."

692
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,870
All that stuff is--
It's really juvenile.

693
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,289
-You sound gay.
-You really do.

694
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,499
Okay, first of all,

695
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,462
your last girlfriend was Amy Sussman
in the seventh grade,

696
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,339
and you dated
for, like, three hours.

697
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:12,178
And you-- you've been
with Robyn since, what-- like 1998?

698
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,889
-'97.
-'97. See--

699
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,808
-(video game beeps, ending theme plays)
-Shoot.

700
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,729
I don't think the two of you are exactly
authorities on modern relationships.

701
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,529
-So, what should I do?
-You should ask her.

702
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,656
-(sighs)
-What?

703
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,326
Well, why rock the boat,
is what I'm thinking.

704
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,328
I mean, things
are going well.

705
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,206
You start putting labels on it,
that's like the kiss of death.

706
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,001
-It's like saying, "I love you."
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

707
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,004
That's what happened
between me and Sean.

708
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,632
-Who the hell's Sean?
-My boyfriend before Mark.

709
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,176
Who the-- Never mind.

710
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:56,096
-So, what you're saying--
-I'm saying you do want to ask her.

711
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,391
It's obvious. You're just afraid you'll
get an answer you don't want,

712
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,312
which will shatter all the illusions of
how great these past few months have been.

713
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,439
Now look,
if it were me,

714
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,942
I'd find out now before you
show up at her place

715
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,987
and, well, she's in bed
with Lars from Norway.

716
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,823
-(applause)
-Who's Lars from Norway?

717
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,825
Just some guy
she met at the gym

718
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,204
with Brad Pitt's face
and Jesus' abs.

719
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,917
-(whistle blows)
-Wait! No, Coach. We're not done here.

720
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,002
-Rachel!
-Look, it's easy, Tom.

721
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,712
Just don't be a pussy.

722
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,141
(acoustic guitar playing)

723
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,938
(woman singing in French)

724
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,440
You okay?

725
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,569
-Yeah.
-You sure?

726
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,405
Summer, I gotta
ask you something.

727
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,323
-What?
-What are we, um--

728
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,453
-What are we doing?
-I thought we were going to the movies.

729
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,872
Yeah. Nah, I mean, like,
what are we, like--

730
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,500
What's going on here,
with us?

731
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,419
I don't know.

732
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,214
Who cares?

733
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,134
-I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
-Yeah.

734
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,219
Good.

735
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,763
(music continues)

736
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,396
(vocalizing along to song)

737
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,420
(music ends)

738
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,132
TOM: London, 1964.

739
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,217
Those girls knew
how to dress.

740
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,763
Nowadays, it's all
these giant sunglasses...

741
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,223
and tattoos.

742
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,517
It's handbags with
little dogs in them.

743
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:09,396
-Like, who okayed this?
-Some people like it.

744
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,025
I like how you dress.

745
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,318
I was thinking about getting

746
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,945
a butterfly tattoo
about yea big on my ankle.

747
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,947
-No.
-(chuckles)

748
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,741
Oh.

749
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,118
Yo.

750
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,120
How's it going?

751
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,414
Uh, okay.

752
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,750
You live around here?

753
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,086
Um, yeah, not too far.

754
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,380
I've never
seen you here before.

755
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,632
You're not
too observant.

756
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,802
That's funny.
You're funny.

757
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,137
-So let me buy you a drink.
-No, thank you.

758
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,642
-You with this guy?
-Hey, I'm Tom.

759
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,311
Whatever. So, come on. One drink.
What are you drinking?

760
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,563
I said no, thanks.

761
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,399
You're serious?
This guy?

762
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,442
-Hey, buddy--
-You know what? Don't be rude.

763
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,903
I'm flattered,
but I'm not interested.

764
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,906
So why don't you go over
there and leave us alone? Thanks.

765
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,160
It's a free country.

766
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,215
I can't believe
this is your boyfriend.

767
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,015
What are you doing?

768
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,143
(glass clattering)

769
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,271
TOM: (chuckling)
It was really just a crazy thing.

770
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,691
It happened like--
It felt like it happened fast, but really,

771
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,736
it-- it also felt like it
was happening really slowly,

772
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,029
like everything
all was just-- I don't know.

773
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,491
-It doesn't feel like you think it would--
-(slams drawer)

774
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,327
Hey, what's the matter?

775
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,289
I just-- I can't believe you.

776
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,750
You can't believe me?

777
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,544
You were so completely,
completely uncool in there.

778
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:59,757
Wait. Are you mad at me?
I just got my ass kicked for you.

779
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,925
Oh, really? Was that for me?
Was that for my benefit?

780
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,427
Yes, it was.

781
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,221
Okay, well, next time don't,
'cause I don't need your help.

782
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,516
You know what?
I'm really tired.

783
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,521
Can we talk about this
tomorrow?

784
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,649
(siren wailing in distance)

785
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,568
(exhales)

786
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,703
No. You know what?

787
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,040
I'm not going anywhere till
you tell me what's going on.

788
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,000
Nothing's going on.

789
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,254
(exhales)
We're just--

790
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,467
What? We're just what?

791
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,387
-We're just friends.
-No! Don't pull that with me!

792
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,348
Don't even try to--

793
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:53,060
This is not how
you treat your friend.

794
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:57,147
Kissing in the copy room?
Holding hands in IKEA?

795
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,858
Shower sex? Come on!
Friends, my balls!

796
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,076
I like you, Tom.
I just don't want a relationship--

797
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,620
Well, you're not the only one
that gets a say in this!

798
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,623
I do too! And I say we're
a couple, goddamn it!

799
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,042
(opens door, slams)

800
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,923
After you, please.

801
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,773
(sighs)

802
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,196
(thunder rumbling)

803
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,631
(doorbell buzzes)

804
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,594
(sighs)

805
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,416
I shouldn't
have done that.

806
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,046
-Done what?
-Gotten mad at you.

807
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,006
I'm sorry.

808
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,222
(exhales)
Look, we don't have to put a label on it.

809
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,433
That's fine.
I get it.

810
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,394
But, you know,
I just-- I need some consistency.

811
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,147
I know.

812
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,025
I need to know that
you're not gonna wake up in the morning

813
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,569
and... feel differently.

814
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,454
-And I can't give you that.
-(exhales)

815
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,373
Nobody can.

816
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,421
(whistling)

817
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,507
(sighs, hisses)

818
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,051
That hurt?
I'm sorry.

819
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,637
No, it doesn't hurt.

820
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,889
-I like you.
-(chuckles)

821
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,977
-(giggles)
-All right.

822
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,489
SUMMER: ♪ You loved her
You were kissing ♪

823
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,868
TOM: Shh. Well, what about you?
Did you ever even have a boyfriend?

824
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,912
-SUMMER: Well, of course.
-TOM: Yeah?

825
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,914
-TOM: Yeah.
-SUMMER: Well, tell me about them.

826
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,958
-SUMMER: No.
-TOM: Oh? Why not?

827
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,293
Because
it's not important.

828
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,796
I'm interested.

829
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,756
(sighs)

830
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,176
All right. Fine.
You want to go there?

831
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,262
-Yeah. I can take it.
-Fine.

832
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,101
So--

833
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,396
Well, in high school
there was Markus.

834
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,565
-Quarterback-slash- homecoming king?
-(whistle Blows)

835
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,984
No. He was a rower.

836
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,237
He was very hot.

837
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,031
(chuckles)

838
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,784
For a brief time in college
there was, um-- there was Charlie.

839
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,247
She was nice, but--

840
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,209
And then there was
my semester in Siena.

841
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,128
Fernando Belardelli.

842
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,050
Also known as "The Puma."

843
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,303
-The Puma?
-Yeah, The Puma, 'cause, you know.

844
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,350
So--

845
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,687
-Oh, that's it?
-The ones that lasted, yeah.

846
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,106
What happened? Why--
Why didn't they work out?

847
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,942
What always happens.
Life.

848
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,861
(exhales)

849
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,867
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

850
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,745
No, it's not.
It's awesome. Trust me.

851
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,205
I'm serious.

852
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,291
I'll go first.

853
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,338
(exhales)
Penis.

854
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,932
Penis.

855
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,309
-Penis!
-Penis!

856
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,811
-Penis!
-There's kids around.

857
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,730
-There are no kids around.
-(children giggling)

858
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,066
-Penis!
-Penis!

859
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:53,443
-You having fun?
-Yeah.

860
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,737
This is the kind of thing
you did with The Puma, isn't it?

861
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,032
Oh, we rarely
left the room.

862
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,701
(loud)
Penis!

863
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,411
-Sorry. Tourette's. You know how it is.
-Penis!

864
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,331
-She has it too. Penis!
-(loudly) Penis!

865
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,709
-Shh. Everyone's looking over here.
-I'm done. I'm done.

866
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,419
-Are you done?
-I'm done.

867
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,171
-You're done?
-Yeah.

868
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,340
-This is too much.
-Unleash me. I'm done.

869
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,259
-Promise?
-I promise.

870
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,679
I promise.

871
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,140
(Summer screaming)
Penis!

872
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,100
(laughing)

873
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,407
-TOM: It's very complex.
-SUMMER: Mmm.

874
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,451
In a way,
it sort of, like,

875
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,288
says... so much...

876
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,249
by...

877
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,459
saying so little.

878
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,886
-Do you want to go to the movies?
-Yep.

879
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,517
(no audible dialogue)

880
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,531
(film: MAN speaking French)

881
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,455
He is broken.

882
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,833
More than broken, he is alone.

883
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:37,088
Now his only friend is grief.

884
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,822
-In any case... suffering.
-Suffering.

885
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,492
-Endless suffering.
-So much suffering.

886
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,786
The kind of suffering
that never ends.

887
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,412
-Suffering.
-Suffering.

888
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,832
A shitload of suffering
is what I'm saying.

889
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,257
Your move.

890
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:27,180
Better luck next time...
bitch.

891
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,688
(dramatic music plays)

892
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,829
T-Tom?

893
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,164
Mr. Vance would like to
see you in his office.

894
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,127
-(knocks)
-Tom.

895
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,296
Have a seat.

896
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,006
(exhales)

897
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,885
Has something happened
to you recently?

898
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,179
What do you mean?

899
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,433
A death in the family, someone taken ill--
Anything like that.

900
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,976
No.

901
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,439
Look, I don't mean to pry,
but...

902
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,482
does this have something to do
with Summer leaving?

903
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,777
-Who?
-My assistant.

904
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,781
-Your, um--
-Tom, everyone knows.

905
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,369
Never mind.

906
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:35,206
The reason I'm asking is,
lately your work performance

907
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,001
has been... a little off.

908
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,129
-I'm not following.
-Okay.

909
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,631
Um, here's something
that you wrote last week.

910
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,760
Uh, "Roses are red,
violets are blue.

911
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,179
Fuck you, whore."

912
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,057
Now, most shoppers
at Valentine's Day--

913
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,018
-Mr. Vance, are you firing me?
-No. No.

914
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,104
Relax, Hansen.
You're one of the good ones.

915
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,857
Okay.
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

916
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,984
Things have been
a little difficult.

917
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,321
That's okay. I completely
understand that.

918
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:10,825
I'm just saying that perhaps you could
channel those energies,

919
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,079
um, into something
like this.

920
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,876
Funerals and sympathy.

921
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,296
Misery, sadness,
loss of faith,

922
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,507
no reason to live.

923
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,093
This is perfect for you.

924
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,678
-Uh--
-Good. Okay.

925
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,555
Now back to work you go.

926
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,309
Thank you.

927
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,813
VANCE: Thank you.

928
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,247
-Hey.
-Hey.

929
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,998
Don't you have, like,
20 cards to write by Friday?

930
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,083
Nope. All done.

931
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,126
Really? Can you help me?

932
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,086
'Cause I've run out of ways
to say "congrats."

933
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:07,924
Okay. I got "Good job,"
"Well done," "Way to go."

934
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:08,925
That's it.

935
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:12,470
How 'bout, "Every day
you make me proud...

936
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,015
but today
you get a card."

937
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,393
-Shit, that's good!
-I know.

938
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:23,064
Have you tried "Merry"?

939
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:26,484
-Wow! That's perfect! Merry!
-Wow!

940
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,529
We've been stuck on this
for an hour.

941
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,740
Hmm. How about...

942
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,206
"I love us"?

943
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,708
WOMAN: Aw.

944
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,545
I hate Summer.

945
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,630
I hate her crooked teeth.

946
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,424
I hate her 1960s haircut.

947
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,384
I hate her knobby knees.

948
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,345
And I hate her cockroach-shaped
splotch on her neck.

949
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,307
I hate the way she smacks
her lips before she talks.

950
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,601
And I hate the way she sounds
when she laughs.

951
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,980
♪ She's like the wind ♪

952
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,149
I hate this song!

953
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,525
(bus stops)

954
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,029
Son, you're gonna
have to exit the vehicle.

955
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,531
WOMAN:
I normally don't do blind dates,

956
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,618
but Paul and Robyn spoke
very highly of you.

957
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,120
-Ah.
-They said you write greeting cards.

958
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,247
That's so interesting.
I wanted to write.

959
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,374
I actually
majored in English in college,

960
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,668
but what are you gonna do
with that degree?

961
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,712
-I went to Brown. Where did you go?
-Alison.

962
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,839
Hmm?

963
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,258
Listen,
it's great to meet you,

964
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,761
and... you're a very
attractive girl.

965
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,764
I just wanted to say up front
that this isn't--

966
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:41,184
-It's not gonna go anywhere.
-Oh.

967
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,979
I liked this girl.
I mean, I loved her.

968
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,065
What does she do?

969
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:50,777
She took a giant shit
on my face.

970
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,154
-Literally.
-Literally?

971
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,617
Not literally.
That's disgusting. Jesus.

972
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,827
What's the matter
with you?

973
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,746
The point is--

974
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,458
I'm messed up.
I am.

975
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,669
You know, on the one hand,
I want to forget her.

976
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,546
On the other hand,

977
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,840
I know that she's the only person
in the entire universe

978
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,133
that will make me happy.

979
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,469
-Mm-hmm.
-You ever do this?

980
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,388
You think back on the times
you had with someone,

981
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,306
and you just replay it in your head
over and over again,

982
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,102
and you look for those
first signs of trouble.

983
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,856
There's two options really.

984
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,026
Either...
she's an evil,

985
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,321
emotionless, miserable
human being,

986
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:39,576
or... she's a robot.

987
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,744
Small Wonder.
You know, Vicki.

988
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,497
-That would explain a lot actually.
-Can I ask you a question?

989
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,459
-Yeah.
-She never cheated on you?

990
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,544
-No. Never.

991
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,629
She ever take advantage of you
in any way?

992
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,632
No.

993
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,720
And she told you up front that
she didn't want a boyfriend.

994
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,764
Yeah.

995
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,355
I got a great idea.

996
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,443

you can explain away ♪

997
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:17,113

Oh, fine! Go!
That's fine. See ya.

1001
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,083
Waste of time.
You don't look anything like Summer.

1002
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,839
MAN (on P.A.): Now departing on Track 2,
Pacific Surfliner.

1003
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,133
Full service to Santa Barbara.

1004
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,968
ENGINEER:
All aboard, please.

1005
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,561
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, you here?

1006
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,605
-Hell no.
-What do you mean, "Hell no"?

1007
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,274
-I'm not going to that.
-Yes, you are.

1008
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,443
No, man. It's gonna be
all old people.

1009
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,654
Yeah, but you said you were going.
That's why I'm going.

1010
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,907
And that's why I called her last night,
and told her I was sick.

1011
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,866
Like a ninja.

1012
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,077
Dude! I'm gonna--
I'm not gonna know anybody at this thing.

1013
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,788
Maybe you'll meet
some hot granddaughters or something.

1014
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,665
-I'm hanging up now.
-Bye, baby.

1015
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,959
MAN (on P.A.):
May I have your attention,please?

1016
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,796
Passengers boarding the train
in Los Angeles, please...

1017
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,256
have your tickets out
and ready for collection.

1018
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,175
(continues, indistinct)

1019
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,540
Hi, Tom!

1020
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,167
Hey. Summer.

1021
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,838
-I must have walked right by you.
-Yeah.

1022
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,882
Well, um, what are you doing?
Are you going to Millie's?

1023
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,637
-Me too.
-Cool.

1024

I forgot you knew her.

1025
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,225
Yeah, we worked together
all that time, so--

1026
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,602
-Of course.

1195
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:01,233
I've been calling you every five minutes.
Are you okay?

1196
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,444
-I'm great.
-What happened to you?

1197
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:06,572
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-You always wanna talk about it.

1198
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,074
-Not this.
-Okay. Well, come on. Let's go.

1199
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,369
-Where are we going?
-It's Thursday!

1200
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,706
This one says,
"Go for it!"

1201
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,417
And this one says,
"You can do it!"

1202
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,337
We have a whole line of inspirational
photographic cards

1203
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,630
featuring Pickles, my cat.

1204
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,633
I think people
will really enjoy them.

1205
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:29,678
-Thank you.
-VANCE: Good job, Rhoda.

1206
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,764
That's inspirational stuff.

1207
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,266
Okay. Who's next?

1208
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,145
We haven't heard from
Sympathy in a while.

1209
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,022
-Hansen?
-Yeah?

1210
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,608
The Winter Collection?
Do you have anything to contribute?

1211
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,777
Uh, no.

1212
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,862
I really don't.

1213
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:49,031
(clears throat)
Okay.

1214
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,533
We'll come back to you.
Uh, McKenzie?

1215
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,412
-Actually, you know what?
-Yes, Tom?

1216
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,207
-Can I say something about the cat?
-Well, okay.

1217
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,542
Yeah, uh, this is--

1218
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,711
And, Rhoda,
no disrespect here,

1219
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:06,465
but, um,
this is total shit.

1220
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,801
-Tom.
-"Go for it" and "You can do it"?

1221
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,053
That's not inspirational.
That's suicidal.

1222
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,972
If Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

1223
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,142
It's lies. We're liars.

1224
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,561
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

1225
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,106
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

1226
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:26,026
People buy cards, 'cause they can't say
how they feel, or they're afraid to.

1227
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,612
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

1228
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:32,157
You know what? I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

1229
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,868
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

1230
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:38,080
I mean, look!
What-- What is this? What does it say?

1231
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,124
"Congratulations
on your new baby." Right?

1232
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,418
How 'bout, "Congratulations
on your new baby.

1233
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,253
Guess that's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."

1234
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,838
Sit down, Hansen.

1235
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,923
How 'bout this one,
with all the pretty hearts on the front?

1236
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:49,800
I think I know where this is going. Yep!

1237
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:53,387
"Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart. I love you."

1238
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:57,015
That sweet?
Ain't love grand?

1239
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,226
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1240
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,395
What does that even mean,
"love"?

1241
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:04,314
Do you know?
Do you? Anybody?

1242
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,899
Tom.

1243
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,694
If somebody gave me
this card, Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

1244
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,075
It's-- It's these cards,
and the movies, and the pop songs--

1245
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,744
They're to blame
for all the lies...

1246
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:21,248
and the heartache,
everything.

1247
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:23,876
And we're responsible.
I'm responsible.

1248
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,090
I think we do
a bad thing here.

1249
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,719
People should be able to say
how they feel-- how they really feel,

1250
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,681
not, you know, some words
that some strangers put in their mouths.

1251
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:40,142
Words like "love"...

1252
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,314
that don't mean anything.

1253
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,817
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I, uh--

1254
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,655
I quit. I'm--

1255
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,074
There's enough bullshit
in the world without my help.

1256
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,755
(elevator bell dings)

1257
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,520
WOMAN:
All right. Next we do running drills.

1258
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,772
Hey, you're
sketching again.

1259
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,149
Yeah, well, just doodling.

1260
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:32,861
Okay, Tom. We got 20 seconds.
Talk to me. You okay?

1261
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,988
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great.

1262
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,498
You know, my friends
are all in love with you.

1263
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:46,625
You know,
it's like we said.

1264
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,753
-Plenty of other fish in the sea.
-Thanks.

1265
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:52,089
But, uh, those are guppies.

1266
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,091
(chuckles)
Yeah.

1267
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:57,594
-Hey, Tom?
-Mmm.

1268
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:01,139
Look, I know you think
that she was the one...

1269
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,018
but I don't.

1270
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,272
Now, I think you're just
remembering the good stuff.

1271
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,358
Next time
you look back, I, uh--

1272
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:13,735
I really think
you should look again.

Um, I don't know.
We could just go back to your place or--

1276
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,575
No, I really want to see it.

I guess I should say
congratulations.

1324
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,652
Only if you mean it.

1325
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:31,363
Ah. Well, in that case--

1326
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,164
So, are you okay?

1327
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:44,292
I will be, eventually.

1328
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,628

-Hmm.

-You look sharp.

1332
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,764
-So do you.
-(chuckles) Thanks.

1333
01:22:57,847 --> 01:23:00,308
-I quit the office.
-You did?

1334
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,560
I didn't know.
That's great!

1335
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:06,272
And you, um--

1336
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,359
you're married.

1337
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,987
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

1338
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,415
You should have told me
when we were at the--

1339
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,624
I know.

1340
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,127
You know, at the wedding
when we were dancing.

1341
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,546
-Well, he hadn't asked me yet.
-But he was in your life.

1342
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:32,173
-Yeah.
-So why'd you dance with me?

1343
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,137
'Cause I wanted to.

1344
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,100
You just do what you want,
don't you?

1345
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,860
You never wanted to be
anybody's girlfriend,

1346
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,154
and now you're
somebody's wife.

1347
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:56,406
Surprised me too.

1348
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:59,034
I don't think I'll ever
understand that.

1349
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:03,121
I mean,
it doesn't make sense.

1350
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:07,000
It just happened.

1351
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:10,837
Right, but that's what I don't understand.
What just happened?

1352
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,091
I just-- I just woke up one day,
and I knew.

1353
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,010
Knew what?

1354
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,848
What I was never sure of
with you.

1355
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,406
You know what sucks?

1356
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,659
Realizing that everything you believe in
is complete and utter bullshit.

1357
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,828
-It sucks.
-What do you mean?

1358
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:47,874
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

1359
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:52,629
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

1360
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:55,006
You were right.
I-I should have listened to you.

1361
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,301
-No.
-Yeah. What? What are you smiling at?

1362
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,971
-Tom.
-What?

1363
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,518
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1364
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:09,229
Well, you know,

1365
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,689
I guess it's 'cause...

1366
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,234
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray,

1367
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,778
and... a guy
comes up to me

1368
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:19,489
and asks me about it,

1369
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:22,408
and... now he's my husband.

1370
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,914
Yeah. And... so?

1371
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:30,667
So, what if I'd gone
to the movies?

1372
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:36,923
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

1373
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:40,093
What if I'd gotten there
ten minutes later?

1374
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:43,763
It was--

1375
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,224
It was meant to be.

1376
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,810
And I just kept thinking...

1377
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,689
-Tom was right.
-No.

1378
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:54,899
Yeah, I did.

1379
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,318
(laughs)
I did.

1380
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:06,369
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

1381
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,356
I should go.

1382
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,151
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

1383
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:45,575
(whistling)

1384
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:47,577
Summer!

1385
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,831
I really do hope
that you're happy.

1386
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:28,952
NARRATOR:
Most days of the year are unremarkable.

1387
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:32,163
They begin and they end

1388
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:36,125
with no lasting memories
made in between.

1389
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,753
Most days have no impact

1390
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:40,630
on the course of a life.

1391
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:44,550
May 23 was a Wednesday.

1392
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:05,446
-Are you interviewing?
-Sorry?

1393
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:09,158
Are you interviewing
for the position?

1394
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,619
-Oh, yeah. Why? Are you?
-Yeah.

1395
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,663
Mm-hmm.

1396
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,873
My competition.

1397
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,250
It would appear.

1398
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:22,839
Yeah.
So, a little awkward.

1399
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,549
Yeah.

1400
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:30,346
Well, I hope you, um,
don't get the job.

1401
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:34,517
Well, I hope you
don't get the job.

1402
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,519
-(laughs)
-(laughs)

1403
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:39,439
Have I seen you before?

1404
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:40,982
Me? I don't think so.

1405
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,445
Do you ever go
to Angelus Plaza?

1406
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:48,406
Yes. That's, like,
my favorite spot in the city.

1407
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,450
Yeah. Okay. Except for
the parking lots, but--

1408
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:52,493
-Yeah. I-- I agree.
-Yeah, yeah.

1409
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,579
-I think I've seen you there.
-Really?

1410
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,332
-Yeah.
-I haven't seen you.

1411
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,919
You must not
have been looking.

1412
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,838
NARRATOR:
If Tom had learned anything,

1413
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:07,050
it was that you can't ascribe
great cosmic significance

1414
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,093
to a simple earthly event.

1415
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:14,932
Coincidence.
That's all anything ever is.

1416
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,018
Nothing more than coincidence.

1417
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:19,437
-MAN: Tom Hansen.
-Yeah.

1418
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,356
-Come on back.
-Thank you.

1419
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:26,819
Tom had finally learned
there are no miracles.

1420
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,364
There's no such thing
as fate.

1421
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,908
Nothing is meant to be.

1422
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:35,536
He knew.
He was sure of it now.

1423
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:38,373
Tom was--
Sorry. Um--

1424
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,625
I just left, uh--
Can I-- One second.

1425
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,419
NARRATOR:
He was pretty sure.

1426
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:46,672
-Hey.
-You again.

1427
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:49,050
Yeah. I, uh,
was just wondering

1428
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:52,220
if maybe after this,
if, um, you--

1429
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,849
you want to get some coffee
or something.

1430
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,102
Oh, I'm sorry.

1431
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:03,022
I'm sort of supposed to
meet someone after this.

1432
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,982
Okay.

1433
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,492
Sure.

1434
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:17,245
-What's that?
-(laughs) Why not?

1435
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:20,581
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh--
I'll wait for you--

1436
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,875
-We-- We'll figure it out.
-We'll figure it out.

1437
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:26,879
-My name's Tom.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.
