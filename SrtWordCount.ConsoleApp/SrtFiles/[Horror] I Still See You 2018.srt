1
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:59,148
Everyone remembers
where they were that day.

2
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:00,399
The day of The Event.

3
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:04,862
All right,
so we're gonna go back to the start.

4
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,823
What should we name him?
What should we name Super Dog?

5
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:09,783
What do you think?
Doug.

6
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,619
Doug? Sure.

7
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:16,582
Let's see. I'll find his picture.

8
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,378
Um... all right.

9
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:24,548
What I want to ask you guys today is,
who has pets at home?

10
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:28,510
A Rottweiler.
You have a Rottweiler? What?

11
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:51,950
It's okay. It's okay.

12
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:55,829
Look at me.
Ronnie, look at me!

13
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,541
It's okay.

14
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,451
Morning, babe.
Morning.

15
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,714
Thanks, Mom.

16
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,550
There
is no basis to the theories

17
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:33,760
of the socalled Truther Movement.

18
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,889
The Joint Congressional
Committee's findings

19
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:40,142
were confirmed
by independent investigations.

20
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:44,104
Reports of new remnants
cannot be verified.

21
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:52,946
So Janine and I were talking,

22
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,616
and she said that she saw
a new one on the bus yesterday.

23
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,786
Do we have to talk about these things
every morning, babe?

24
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,955
These things?

25
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,916
It's nothing to get upset about,
sweetheart.

26
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:07,294
I'm not getting upset. It's just that you
always say stuff like that,

27
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,671
and you're pretending
like he's not even...

28
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,929
even there.

29
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:23,101
I'm gonna go to school.
Thanks for breakfast.

30
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,198
That's my life.

31
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,367
That's all our lives since it happened.

32
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,788
The Event took
people we cared about,

33
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:46,500
but it also left
a part of them behind.

34
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,918
Remnants.

35
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,003
We all see them.

36
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,799
Every day.

37
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:55,801
Everywhere.

38
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:04,309
It's like walking
through a haunted house...

39
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:08,522
but it's the whole world
that's haunted.

40
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,241
Jewel City, Illinois.

41
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:24,079
We were only 50 miles
from ground zero.

42
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:29,751
A government lab
had some kind of meltdown.

43
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,795
Preliminary reports tonight

44
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,672
indicating an explosion
at Ashburn Labs in Chicago.

45
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,174
The source of the blast
was a large particle collider,

46
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:37,926
part of an advanced
energy research program

47
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,846
headed by noted physicist
Dr. Martin Steiner.

48
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:43,849
The energy wave
left buildings standing,

49
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:45,350
but the people in its path...

50
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,646
weren't so lucky.

51
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:55,527
All anyone knows for sure
is that we can never go back,

52
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,655
back to a world
before the no-go zone.

53
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,324
...declaring the city
of Chicago a no-go zone.

54
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,161
To a world before
every house had a panic room.

55
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:11,334
To a world where the kids
who pretended you didn't exist...

56
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:14,796
actually did exist.

57
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,594
To a world before all this.

58
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:24,139
To a world before...
Ghosts.

59
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:27,476
Ghouls. Specters.
Spectral remnants.

60
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:30,145
"Rems," as the kids say.

61
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,522
What else do you got?
Spooks?

62
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:36,526
Spooks. Love it.
Yeah, spooks. Scares me.

63
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,904
He's so hot.

64
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,909
All right, let's get to work.
Uh, Mr. Trantolo.

65
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:47,829
Looking a little nervous
under that handsome head of hair,

66
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:49,790
which is odd because
I know you did the reading.

67
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,416
What are the three laws
of spectral remnants?

68
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,668
Make me proud, James Dean.
Loser!

69
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:56,129
Law one, they aren't sentient.

70
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,173
They're not conscious-thinking beings.

71
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:02,094
They're projections of the past.
Like holograms.

72
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:05,680
Very good. Law two.
Miss McNulty?

73
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,974
Um, they can't alter their imagery.

74
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:10,685
Exactly. Once remnants appear,

75
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,064
they do the same thing
for the same time every time

76
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,775
like a film reel being replayed.

77
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,652
These are loops.

78
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,404
Might be a five-second loop,
maybe five minutes.

79
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:23,990
But they never vary
and they always repeat.

80
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:29,037
So now, for the big finish,
law three, Miss Calder.

81
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,628
Um, if we could have
a minute of your attention.

82
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,339
Law three.

83
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,675
Um, they can't affect
our natural world.

84
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,845
Very good, Veronica Calder.

85
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:47,180
Remnant phenomenon
may be very diverse.

86
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:51,184
They might be playing out moments
of their life, even their own death,

87
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:56,022
but no matter what, they can't think,
they can't change, they can't touch.

88
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,861
So why is it that the ghosts... rems...

89
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:03,071
aren't just the people
who died in The Event?

90
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:05,824
Well, there's a lot
we still don't understand.

91
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:10,787
Our best guess is that they are drawn
to locations of emotional significance.

92
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,665
There's evidence that rems
have always been around us.

93
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:16,751
Hiroshima. Nagasaki. Chernobyl.

94
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,087
In each of these events,
though, enough time goes by

95
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,381
and there are few remnants to be found,

96
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:23,383
so the consensus is that's what will
eventually happen here

97
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,510
as we get further from The Event.

98
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:29,097
I see the face of a skeptic.

99
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:31,725
Miss Calder, speak.

100
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:35,103
Well, it's just-I mean, if that's true,

101
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:38,356
then why does it seem
like there are more of them?

102
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:44,446
What evidence do you
have to support this theory?

103
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:48,366
What about her?

104
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:34,037
Okay, girl, so your birthday
is in like a week.

105
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,958
So I was thinking, get a little crazy,
have a little bit of a party...

106
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,669
Lady Calder. A word.

107
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,591
A "C."

108
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:48,301
That's not really your look.

109
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:52,555
I've come to expect hoodies,
scowls, and A s.

110
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,724
Talk to me. What's the deal?

111
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:58,353
Is this your daughter?

112
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:02,274
Yeah. She's my angel. That's, like--
feels like two seconds ago.

113
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,776
She's your age now.
Wait a minute.

114
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,069
Oh, my God. Wait.

115
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,446
You were sucking up to me
to try to distract me, weren't you?

116
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,073
I was not.
That's my move.

117
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:12,575
You stole that move from me.
Get your own move.

118
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,787
But Ronnie, until then, focus.

119
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,499
I know what kind of potential you have.
I just need you to work with me.

120
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:22,627
Okay.
Here goes.

121
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,923
Early birthday present.
Thank you.

122
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,218
Oh, and Ronnie, one more thing.

123
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:33,471
If you need to talk to anybody...
Your door is always open?

124
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,974
No, actually I was gonna
say try another teacher first,

125
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:40,353
but, uh, yeah, sure,
let's go with that.

126
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,147
See you tomorrow, Mr. Bittner.

127
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,524
So I didn't tell her
she looked fat,

128
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,067
but she most definitely looked fat.

129
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,527
I mean, some people just
don't understand

130
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,530
that you can't wear a crop top
with low-rise jeans.

131
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:54,034
What's up with you and Ghost Boy?

132
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:55,535
Ghost Boy?

133
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,996
Kirk Lane?
He's like obsessed with rems.

134
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,290
He got expelled from his old school

135
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,334
and ended up in a mental
hospital or something.

136
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,711
Whatever he did, I heard it was bad.

137
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:06,963
Like, really bad.

138
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,637
Why are the cute ones
always sociopaths?

139
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:33,114
You have to let go, Ronnie.

140
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:35,950
Try to let go, baby.

141
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,494
You can do it.

142
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,579
You got it.

143
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:40,955
You got it! You're doing it!

144
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,001
Oh, that's-that's it. That's it!

145
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:51,132
Okay, now come back.

146
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,722
I got you.

147
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:00,558
You never need to be scared, baby.

148
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,935
Right here. Come on!

149
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,735
Come here. I got you.

150
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,280
Oh, I got you!

151
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:30,130
When you need me,
I'll always be here, Ronnie.

152
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:33,800
Always.

153
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,636
Ready? Go, baby!

154
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,508
Ron?

155
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,184
Okay, people. Listen up.

156
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:51,688
You will write a research paper
based on a topic...

157
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:59,445
...split you
into pairs for this project.

158
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,991
Now, it's essential...
Mr. Bittner?

159
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,338
Ronnie, your ear.

160
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,770
Ooh! Ah, sorry. Hi.
Easy, Miss Calder.

161
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:36,107
Hey. How's that ear doing?
Fine. It's nothing.

162
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,028
Good. You know you're really doing
something right as a teacher

163
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,989
when the students ears
start to bleed spontaneously.

164
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,284
Hey, uh, Mr. Bittner!

165
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,161
I was wondering
if I could I ask you something.

166
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,538
It's important.
It's last period on Friday.

167
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:53,625
Nothing's important right now.
It's about remnants.

168
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:58,796
Is this related
to your school project?

169
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:07,180
Okay. You know where I live, right?
James Road, by the Richards' old place?

170
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:09,974
Yeah.
I have office hours at home today.

171
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:11,726
I have some time after my last session.

172
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:14,896
At 5:30. Don't be late.

173
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,941
Remember we talked
about your attention issues.

174
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:22,737
Just keep working on that last paragraph,
bud. It's gonna be great.

175
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,198
I just... know it.

176
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:28,284
Come on in, Ronnie.
I appreciate your punctuality.

177
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:32,080
The place is a madhouse. Eva!

178
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:34,123
No. It's really beautiful.

179
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,834
Oh. Thank you.

180
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:40,213
It's kind of a mess
right now. Come on up.

181
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:42,465
Let me get this out of the way. Eva!

182
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:44,967
Eva!

183
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,888
Eva. Homework.
Finish it, now.

184
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,556
I'll be down to check it
when I'm done here.

185
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,974
This is not a drill.

186
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,895
No hug, no hello.

187
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,313
Tell me something.

188
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:00,817
You turn into a teenager
and you just stop hugging your dad?

189
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,236
Is that a rule or something?

190
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,320
I wouldn't know.

191
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,369
I'm sorry, Ronnie.
It's all right.

192
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:14,038
Well, uh, other than
making you feel horrible...

193
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:16,916
...how can I help you?

194
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:21,587
Hypothetically, could a ghost or a rem
communicate with someone?

195
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,215
What would this ghost have said?

196
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:27,343
He didn't say anything.
You said he talked.

197
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:31,764
I said he communicated.
What, did he send you a Snapchat?

198
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:36,060
Aren't you mildly impressed
I know what Snapchat is?

199
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:38,563
It's very impressive,
Mr. Bittner. Anyways...

200
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,691
I was in the shower.
He was in the bathroom?

201
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:44,986
Yeah. He was at the sink,
and then I slipped.

202
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,572
I fell, hit my head.
You hit your head, Ronnie.

203
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:49,449
Yeah, but I didn't hit it that hard.

204
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:52,034
Hard enough to have your ear
bleed all over my class.

205
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,953
Have you ever had a concussion?

206
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,580
Ronnie...
I know what I saw.

207
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,666
Remnants can't communicate
with you, Ronnie.

208
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,462
They're just... residue.

209
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:06,549
Reminders of things we want to remember,
things we wish we could forget,

210
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,343
but that's all they are,
for better or for worse.

211
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,428
But the laws, they...

212
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,096
I know what you thought
you saw, Ronnie,

213
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,640
but it just isn't possible.

214
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:47,126
Why are you following me?
Holy shit!

215
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,629
Hi. Um...

216
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,422
I...

217
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:58,137
Look, I saw this new remnant
in my bathroom yesterday, and...

218
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,389
I've never seen it. It was new.

219
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:07,229
Come with me.

220
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,065
No. I'm not-I'm not going in there.

221
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:11,233
Hey, you followed me.

222
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,133
Kirk?

223
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,388
Get ready.
For what?

224
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,483
Okay, go. Count! Count them.
Count them. Count these.

225
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,285
There are so many.
I'm losing track.

226
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:17,633
Holy shit.

227
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,345
There were 16 last month.

228
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:24,306
Hey!

229
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,309
So, wait. Hold on.
You're like a Truther?

230
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:30,521
I just have more questions
than some people seem to.

231
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:34,942
Like you. I've seen you in class,
you're awake.

232
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,154
Okay, so then help me.

233
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:40,698
Help me figure out who this rem is.

234
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,456
No, thanks. I'm good.

235
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,460
The paper. For Bittner?

236
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:55,963
You need a partner. Come on.

237
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:59,842
Do this for me, and I'll write the papers
for the both of us. Please.

238
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:07,266
This rem, why do you care?
What makes him so special?

239
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:12,813
I think he might want to hurt me.

240
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:19,862
Thanks.
Okay, what we need to do

241
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:22,823
is figure out who this rem is, or was.

242
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:29,747
Sorry.

243
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:34,919
Okay, I say we take Brian's photo,

244
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:36,587
and then we Google--
Whoa. What did you say?

245
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:39,757
You called the rem Brian. Why?

246
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:44,970
I... I don't know.

247
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:48,474
It just popped into my head, I guess.

248
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:55,940
Look, it's not that simple. You can't just
take a photograph of a rem.

249
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:58,943
You gotta have a spectrographic lens.
Those things cost millions of dollars.

250
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:01,112
Okay, so we improvise.

251
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:03,697
Chandler Deckert. He's been in love
with me since the 7th grade.

252
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:04,782
He'll help us.

253
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,374
Still got it.
In theory,

254
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:17,044
it would be possible to simulate
the effect of a spectrographic field

255
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:18,671
and capture a rem
on a regular camera.

256
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:20,714
Great.
I can show you how,

257
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,300
but I'd need something in return.

258
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:26,804
Like what?
One date.

259
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:28,097
No.
No.

260
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,183
Tell people we hooked up.

261
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:34,353
Fine.
No.

262
00:24:34,436 --> 00:24:36,188
All right. You're gonna
need a couple things:

263
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:39,233
black lights, air purifier, and, um...

264
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:43,237
Oh, you may need to steal some things
from the chem supply closet.

265
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:51,620
A spectrograph basically
generates a charged environment

266
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:55,666
in which spectral particles, what makes up
a remnant, are capturable on film.

267
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:00,421
Shh! My mom's asleep.

268
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:07,469
Most air purifiers use
what's called a negative ion generator,

269
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:10,973
a series of wires in there creates
gas molecules with negative charges

270
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:14,101
that stick to whatever's in the air
and collect in the filter.

271
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,565
What we're gonna do is reverse that.

272
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:22,860
Send those particles out into the air
and charge that bathroom up.

273
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,284
Remnants are also
technically phosphorous.

274
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,161
They emit invisible light
in response to radiation.

275
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:36,457
So to complete the effect and make sure
your camera captures it,

276
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,375
you hit it with a black light.

277
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:44,465
Then just point and shoot.

278
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:56,143
You haven't seen Brian
since that morning, right?

279
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:58,229
He might not be coming.

280
00:25:58,312 --> 00:26:01,523
No. He'll show.

281
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,867
Mom?

282
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:02,167
Kirk! Kirk!

283
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:05,004
Kirk! Kirk! There was...
There was a man.

284
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:08,299
He disappeared or he ran...
Hey, hey, calm down. Shh.

285
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:12,386
Just calm down, okay?

286
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:15,306
Okay, you stay here. Do you have
anything I can use as a weapon?

287
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:25,941
I thought I told you to stay put.
Yeah, I heard you.

288
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,860
Fine, then just stay behind me.

289
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:40,706
Oh!
No!

290
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,667
Who is this?

291
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:45,461
Um...

292
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:49,131
This is Kirk.
Kirk, meet my mom.

293
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:51,425
Mom, meet Kirk.
Hi.

294
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:55,012
Uh, we were working on a school project
together. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

295
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,221
Are you okay, baby?
Are you hurt?

296
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:57,639
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

297
00:27:57,723 --> 00:28:01,852
Yeah. I heard something downstairs
and, my God, I was so scared.

298
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,437
Did you see what the guy looked like?

299
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,734
Um, no. I mean, it was dark,
but it could have been a rem.

300
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,611
Brian.

301
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:13,364
I guess, but I don't...
No, Ronnie. It's 6:30.

302
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:17,701
I mean, Brian.
What? Who?

303
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:18,827
Mom, somebody was in here.

304
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:20,371
Call the police.
What?

305
00:28:20,454 --> 00:28:21,580
Just call them, please, now!

306
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,962
Huh.
It's not working.

307
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:32,257
Kirk!
Just hold on.

308
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,884
Just gimme-this--
this should work.

309
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,221
You really needed
my help on this project.

310
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:42,684
Point and shoot.

311
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,965
This didn't happen last time.

312
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:22,683
Ronnie!

313
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:26,562
What the hell just happened?

314
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:42,578
Brian?

315
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,706
He's a killer, Ronnie.

316
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,342
So I downloaded
the video we shot,

317
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:59,178
image-searched Brian's face
and this is what came up.

318
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:04,141
"Pastor Greer's daughter, Mary Greer,
was abducted four years ago next week."

319
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,893
They found her body in the lake.

320
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:08,479
They have a photo of her the day
before she disappeared.

321
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:12,733
The pastor's daughter.
Mary Greer.

322
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:17,112
You were worried he wants to hurt you?
Maybe you were right.

323
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,215
There she is.

324
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:05,536
What would you like to know about the boy
who murdered my daughter?

325
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:08,580
Do you know his name?

326
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,333
No.

327
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:17,673
Whoever he was,
I do know he stalked her first.

328
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,678
He followed her on campus.

329
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:31,562
He approached her there.

330
00:31:40,654 --> 00:31:45,284
They apparently got into
some kind of... disagreement.

331
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:48,787
Stop! Stop!
Stop, Mary. Listen, Mary.

332
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,374
Somehow, he eventually persuaded
my daughter to come with him.

333
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:59,423
He was the last person she
was seen alive with before...

334
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,222
Police found him at a local motel...

335
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,815
the day after they found Mary.

336
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:35,959
Okay, so we know
Mary Greer, this mystery guy,

337
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:39,254
he abducts her...
Strangles her.

338
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:41,590
...and then he kills her.

339
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:44,468
Why? Who...
How does he know her?

340
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:46,595
And, I mean,
does she even know him?

341
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:50,349
He's not from here. If he was,
Jewel City's not that big of a place.

342
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,852
Somebody would have known him,
so I doubt she did.

343
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:56,229
Yeah, but he knows me,
and he knew her.

344
00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:59,650
So... how?
We're missing something.

345
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,026
Yeah.

346
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:05,530
Wait, why are Mary's ages
different on all of these?

347
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:07,074
Let me see.

348
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:12,871
Well, here's why.

349
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:16,375
The day she went missing was
the day before her birthday.

350
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,336
That's why the ages
on the articles are different.

351
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,047
When they found her,
it was already past her birthday.

352
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,383
She was already
a year older, technically.

353
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:27,969
"Mary Greer was
born February 29th."

354
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,973
Leap Day.

355
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:35,644
So?

356
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:40,190
That's my birthday.

357
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:55,580
We're closing in five minutes.

358
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,460
Come on. Let's go.

359
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,592
Ronnie.

360
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:26,445
I don't remember writing any of that.

361
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:40,417
Mr. Lane.

362
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:45,630
I received a call this morning
from Pastor Greer

363
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:49,760
about a Jewel City student harassing her
about her daughter's death.

364
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:52,471
Would you like
to explain this to me?

365
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,056
School project.

366
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:01,730
You won't be smiling
if I suspend you, Mr. Lane.

367
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:06,109
So what's the real reason
you went to Pastor Greer?

368
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:21,082
I cannot believe
you dragged me here.

369
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,085
I had to. I barely see you anymore.

370
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,422
Oh, my God.

371
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:28,882
There's my boyfriend.

372
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:31,510
And where's yours?

373
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:33,261
He's not my boyfriend.

374
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:38,350
And this, um,
this isn't exactly Kirk's scene.

375
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:41,061
Oh, it's not. Okay.

376
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:43,855
So what is Kirk's scene?
What does Kirk like to do?

377
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:46,858
He's normal, I guess.

378
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:50,070
Okay, Kirk Lane is normal?

379
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:52,572
Okay. That's new. All right.

380
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:55,534
Great.

381
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:07,754
He's not a bad guy, you know.
He's just... different.

382
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,801
Okay. All I'm saying is that maybe people
are weirded out by him for a reason.

383
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:17,597
Well, you can't always
judge a book by its cover...

384
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,184
What's up?

385
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:28,358
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

386
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:31,570
Oh.
Excuse me. Sorry.

387
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,877
Excuse me. Sorry.

388
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:36,092
Sorry.

389
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:21,221
Ronnie!

390
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:49,416
Oh, my God! Mr. Pescatelli!

391
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:14,941
Initial reports are Jewel High School
principal William Pescatelli

392
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,276
committed suicide.

393
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,778
The school community is devastated...
I'll get it.

394
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:22,115
and police are investigating
the details of what happened.

395
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:25,201
Why the hell aren't you
answering your phone?

396
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:27,662
It's charging. What's up?

397
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,505
Ronnie, I told him. Pescatelli,
I told him about us and Greer.

398
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:40,258
He said he'd look into it,
and now he's dead.

399
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:41,885
They're saying it's a suicide.

400
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:46,222
No, Ronnie, listen to me.
That is why he's dead.

401
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:48,308
I'm telling you, Ronnie,
something is going on here.

402
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:49,809
He's dead because I told him.

403
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:52,437
Kirk, come on, we don't know that.

404
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,732
And, in case you're wondering,
no, I have not found the other one

405
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:58,234
since you attempted
to kill my mother with it.

406
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:00,320
Yeah, no,
I am sorry about that.

407
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:02,822
You do have amazingly
large feet, by the way.

408
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:05,283
Uh, those are actually my dad's skates.

409
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:11,122
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

410
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,750
It's probably better than the alternative.

411
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,752
I never cried once my dad died.

412
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:18,963
Not once.

413
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:22,967
What was your last memory
of him? Something good?

414
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,513
I yelled at him that morning.

415
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,517
I was having a tantrum about I...

416
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,103
I don't even
know what it was about.

417
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:34,729
I mean, it was about nothing. I was six.

418
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:37,565
And, um...

419
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,945
I told him I didn't love him.

420
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:46,783
And every morning
was usually the same.

421
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:48,827
Bye.
He'd shake his head

422
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,163
and he'd say, "Bye for now."

423
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,124
He would take the train to work,

424
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,544
unless he was late,

425
00:40:57,627 --> 00:41:03,466
like he was that day because of me.
So then he took his car.

426
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,386
But if he would have
just taken the train,

427
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:09,931
then he would have gone east,
and would have been fine

428
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:13,768
because the shock wave
didn't go that far.

429
00:41:13,852 --> 00:41:17,188
But he, um...

430
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:20,108
he took the freeway.

431
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,861
It's...

432
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,700
It's all my fault.

433
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:32,370
I know that everybody
says that it's not, you know,

434
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:36,708
that it's his time, and that it was his--

435
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:40,962
But it wasn't.

436
00:41:44,507 --> 00:41:48,303
You know I've never
even been to his grave?

437
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:51,139
Not once.

438
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:56,686
How messed up is that?

439
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:04,777
See this?

440
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:09,824
All this. You want
to know why I track rems?

441
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:14,996
Because you want to know
why they show up, right?

442
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:20,418
No, I want to know
why my dad doesn't.

443
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:24,088
I meet all these rems
every single day, but...

444
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,884
Not him.

445
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:33,306
Never him, and every single day,
I think I'm gonna walk around the corner,

446
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,642
and there he'll be, and it's all gonna
make sense, but...

447
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,102
never does.

448
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:43,816
That's what scares me the most.
I mean, what if...

449
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:48,029
him dying, me living,
what if it all means nothing?

450
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:53,034
That's why I keep looking.

451
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:00,458
Ron?

452
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:06,589
Hi, Mom.
Hey, Ron.

453
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:09,926
Um, it's so late,
and with the roads icing over,

454
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:12,178
I thought maybe Kirk
should just stay over.

455
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:15,181
I made up the sofa bed for him.

456
00:43:15,265 --> 00:43:19,435
Good night.
Good night.

457
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,084
It's okay, baby.

458
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:11,070
Ah!

459
00:45:25,061 --> 00:45:28,064
Ronnie! Babe, what's the matter?

460
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:32,735
Nothing. I... I was
just having a nightmare.

461
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,779
Baby, why is the window open?

462
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,411
What does "darkness falls" mean?
What?

463
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:43,246
Before you woke up,
I heard you saying it.

464
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:47,083
You kept repeating it.
"Darkness... falls."

465
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,669
Uh, I don't know.

466
00:45:49,752 --> 00:45:53,381
Well, come on downstairs.
Your breakfast is getting cold.

467
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:55,383
And close that window.

468
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:10,106
Morning.
Hi.

469
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:13,151
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

470
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:15,528
Oh, Ronnie, I wanted to tell you.

471
00:46:15,611 --> 00:46:18,322
I got a call from that office in Overton
I told you about.

472
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:20,908
And they want me to come in
for a job interview.

473
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:23,786
It's on the 28th, so I'm probably
going to stay over.

474
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,621
So you're gonna miss my birthday.

475
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:28,749
I'm gonna come back
later that afternoon.

476
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,085
So whatever you want us to do,
we can still do, okay?

477
00:46:31,169 --> 00:46:33,296
Okay.

478
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:40,678
What?
That's his chair.

479
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:43,848
I'm so sorry.
No, no, you didn't...

480
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:46,309
It's okay.
I didn't know. Should I...?

481
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:48,686
Just sit.
Uh...

482
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:53,357
It's okay. Really, it's...
Sit there.

483
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:01,866
I'm so tired.

484
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:04,076
How was the sofa bed?

485
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,372
Did you get any sleep?
Because I definitely didn't.

486
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:10,625
Oh, it was exhausting.

487
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,377
I had this dream about Brian...

488
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:15,087
Ronnie, Ronnie.

489
00:47:15,171 --> 00:47:18,007
You said your dad died in The Event
ten years ago, right?

490
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,342
Yeah.

491
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:21,802
Look at date on the newspaper.
It's only eight years old.

492
00:47:21,886 --> 00:47:23,304
What?

493
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:27,391
Wait, how is that even possible?

494
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:31,395
Get me a pen. Get me a pen, quick.
Yeah.

495
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:44,617
Okay, how much time do I have?
Almost.

496
00:47:55,795 --> 00:47:57,380
Done.

497
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:02,802
Okay. Maybe... maybe the image changed,
or maybe it was there the whole time,

498
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:05,012
maybe you didn't know,
but either way, Ronnie,

499
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:07,098
I'm pretty sure he's trying to warn you.

500
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:14,355
Okay. I found another article.
This is eight years ago.

501
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:16,649
Emma Shaw goes missing
on the 29th, Leap Day.

502
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:18,109
Her killer is never found.

503
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:20,319
But the police believed it was linked

504
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:23,614
to the disappearance
and murder of another area girl,

505
00:48:23,698 --> 00:48:27,201
Claire White, who was found dead
February 28th a year earlier.

506
00:48:27,285 --> 00:48:31,497
Were there any living relatives?
Uh, no.

507
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:33,708
Emma Shaw's family moved away,

508
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,502
but Claire White still
has a sister in Aurora.

509
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:46,220
Claire had this boyfriend, Brian.

510
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,097
Last name?
Never knew it.

511
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,850
Claire and I weren't
all that close before...

512
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,439
Anyway, she was obsessed.

513
00:48:56,522 --> 00:48:59,483
She moved to Chicago only after
a few months to be with him.

514
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:02,987
I thought things were moving
a little too fast, but that was Claire.

515
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,281
Where did they find her body?

516
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,621
Do you want to watch her die?

517
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:21,297
I'll give you the address, but you might
wanna think twice before going.

518
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,425
Why is that?
Because it's in the no-go zone.

519
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:40,232
This is an emergency
broadcast alert announcement.

520
00:49:40,316 --> 00:49:42,485
You are entering a restricted area.

521
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:45,321
Authorized US government
personnel only.

522
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:48,157
Turn around now and go
to the nearest checkpoint.

523
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:56,457
This is an emergency broadcast
alert announcement.

524
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,834
You are entering a restricted area.

525
00:49:58,918 --> 00:50:01,170
Authorized US government
personnel only.

526
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:04,882
Turn around now and go
to the nearest checkpoint.

527
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:12,973
This is an emergency broadcast
alert announcement.

528
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:15,893
You are entering a restricted area.

529
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,285
You know you don't have
to do this, Ronnie.

530
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,208
You coming?

531
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:01,981
My dream.

532
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:06,277
I kept saying...

533
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:10,656
Darkness Falls.

534
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:16,245
Come on, we got to move.

535
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:32,303
Hey.

536
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:46,192
Can you read?

537
00:51:50,946 --> 00:51:54,450
Come on, it's not actually electrified.
They're just trying to scare people.

538
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,661
I hope. Yeah, I hope.

539
00:51:57,745 --> 00:51:59,789
I hope.

540
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:04,210
See?

541
00:52:06,045 --> 00:52:08,631
I got bolt cutters in my bag.

542
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:11,300
Why do you have bolt cutters?
Don't ask.

543
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:58,305
Are they all...?

544
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:01,684
Yeah.

545
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:45,311
Their loops don't even end.

546
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:48,939
How is this even possible?

547
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:51,525
The energy that makes remnants
possible is strongest here

548
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:54,111
because we're so close to ground zero.

549
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:56,405
That's why their loops
seem continuous.

550
00:53:56,488 --> 00:54:00,159
They're not just repeating moments,
they're repeating days, weeks.

551
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:04,455
Some might even be repeating
their entire lives.

552
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:38,822
Just keep moving, okay?

553
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:23,325
Let's get out of here, man.

554
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:32,668
Locals.
Definitely not rems.

555
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,424
Ronnie, follow my lead.
What?

556
00:55:38,507 --> 00:55:39,675
Don't say anything.

557
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:44,638
Yo.

558
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,350
Look at this.

559
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:52,354
This one's new.

560
00:55:52,438 --> 00:55:54,940
Yeah, so what?
There's new ones here every day.

561
00:56:03,866 --> 00:56:05,951
Come on, let's go.

562
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:20,549
Did we have to be kissing
to make that work?

563
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:22,926
No, probably not. Come on.

564
00:56:29,058 --> 00:56:31,101
This is
the address she gave us.

565
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:35,814
Ronnie, this is the collider lab.

566
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:39,068
This is ground zero.

567
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,329
Are you here to see the ghosts?

568
00:56:59,797 --> 00:57:02,049
There's all kinds of ghosts here.

569
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:09,181
We heard you can watch a girl die.

570
00:57:09,264 --> 00:57:10,974
Money?

571
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:17,773
You can't miss her.

572
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:21,110
Go all the way to the back,
then down the stairs.

573
00:57:21,193 --> 00:57:23,028
Have fun.

574
00:57:28,325 --> 00:57:29,326
Freaks.

575
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:47,177
Shit.

576
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:56,728
I don't understand.
I thought this place was a lab.

577
00:57:56,812 --> 00:57:59,523
We must be seeing rems from
before the lab even existed.

578
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:04,611
In the Great Chicago Fire,
people jumped from the rooftops.

579
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:30,012
Must have been
a bathhouse at some point.

580
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:43,817
And a hospital during the wars.

581
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:14,306
So what do we do,
just stand around in the dark?

582
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:19,645
Yeah, we wait.
Until what?

583
00:59:22,898 --> 00:59:23,899
That.

584
00:59:30,572 --> 00:59:32,532
Look, here she comes. I like this.

585
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:40,123
There she is.

586
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,395
She knew her attacker.

587
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:09,087
Let's get out of here.

588
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:12,674
Ronnie.

589
01:01:12,758 --> 01:01:14,593
Dr. Steiner.

590
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,347
Martin Steiner.

591
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,601
Kirk!

592
01:01:25,103 --> 01:01:28,357
Steiner! Dr. Steiner!
Hey! Wait!

593
01:01:35,906 --> 01:01:36,907
Dr. Steiner!

594
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,619
What the hell!
I'm sorry.

595
01:01:40,702 --> 01:01:43,121
Kirk, wait!
Sorry, I'm sorry! Wait!

596
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:51,838
Come on!
No, no, just wait. Just wait.

597
01:02:02,808 --> 01:02:04,351
There he is. Ronnie! Ronnie!
Come here.

598
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:06,269
Hey! Hey!

599
01:02:14,986 --> 01:02:17,364
No, no, no. Wait.
Wait. This way.

600
01:02:25,497 --> 01:02:26,498
Steiner!

601
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29,126
Steiner!

602
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:31,128
I'm just trying to help!
We just want to talk to you!

603
01:02:31,211 --> 01:02:35,173
About Claire White!
You should go!

604
01:02:35,257 --> 01:02:38,385
And Brian.
I said go!

605
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:40,679
Easy! Okay! We're gonna go!
We're gonna go!

606
01:02:40,762 --> 01:02:42,139
Okay, come on.
You know him, don't you?

607
01:02:42,222 --> 01:02:43,640
You don't think I'll pull it?
Don't you?

608
01:02:43,723 --> 01:02:45,100
Get the hell out!
Brian! You know him!

609
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:48,645
You want to shoot me?
Well, then shoot me!

610
01:02:48,728 --> 01:02:52,190
Because if I leave here without answers,
then I'm dead anyway. All right?

611
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:55,527
You want to make up
for destroying everyone's lives?

612
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:01,199
Well, maybe start
by helping save mine. Please.

613
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:12,461
This is where I live now.

614
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:17,299
It's-after the explosion,
I-I came back.

615
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:21,428
I felt somehow that this
is the only place that I belonged.

616
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:24,139
I just... Come here.
This way.

617
01:03:53,502 --> 01:03:54,794
Sit.

618
01:03:57,088 --> 01:03:58,798
Uh, when, uh,

619
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:02,093
when the bombs, uh...

620
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:08,767
...over Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

621
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,228
people standing near the explosion

622
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:15,690
absorbed the radiation as they
were incinerated. Uh, yes.

623
01:04:15,774 --> 01:04:20,070
Their shadows were seared
into the walls for all time. Yes.

624
01:04:20,153 --> 01:04:24,324
Yeah, you see, death
works like that, you see.

625
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:28,787
When we die, we leave
an echo of ourselves behind.

626
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:33,333
Yes. Now these echoes,
they can become something more.

627
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:35,710
They can become doorways.

628
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:41,091
See, a doorway through which a person
can reach back and touch the living.

629
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:47,138
My... my research was
to understand these doorways

630
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:50,392
and... and ultimately to create one.

631
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:52,811
You mean create a doorway
between life and death?

632
01:04:52,894 --> 01:04:56,773
Oh, yes, and vice-versa. Vice-versa.

633
01:04:56,856 --> 01:05:01,194
We brought patients
to the brink of death and back.

634
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:04,114
In essence, to see if we could
use a living person

635
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:06,533
as a vessel
to resurrect the deceased.

636
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:15,917
Unfortunately, the closer we got,
the, uh, the more dangerous it became.

637
01:05:16,001 --> 01:05:19,546
What happened that day?
The day of The Event?

638
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:22,924
Instead of building the doorway...

639
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:28,221
we tore a massive hole.

640
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:40,066
What about Brian?

641
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:43,069
Oh. Brian was
my research assistant.

642
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:44,738
He was young, but brilliant.

643
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:47,240
He was integral to our work here.

644
01:05:47,324 --> 01:05:49,659
But something, uh, after The Event,

645
01:05:49,743 --> 01:05:52,787
something changed in him.
Something... something broke.

646
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:57,042
And... and when I found out
that his girlfriend Claire

647
01:05:57,125 --> 01:06:00,670
ended up murdered,
I knew he did it.

648
01:06:00,754 --> 01:06:03,131
But there have been
others since Claire.

649
01:06:03,214 --> 01:06:06,635
Spectral transference.
What's spectral transference?

650
01:06:06,718 --> 01:06:10,722
You see, Brian killed the person
that he loved the most,

651
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:15,226
and now he's just
trying to bring them back

652
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:17,312
in... in the body of another.

653
01:06:17,395 --> 01:06:21,775
But Brian's dead. He's a rem,
and a ghost can't kill someone.

654
01:06:21,858 --> 01:06:25,820
I mean, the laws...
The laws are lies, Miss Calder.

655
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:30,659
Bedtime stories for children
to shut their eyes.

656
01:06:34,996 --> 01:06:38,541
He's coming for you now, isn't he?

657
01:06:41,002 --> 01:06:45,298
Claire... Claire's birthday
is the day after tomorrow.

658
01:06:45,382 --> 01:06:47,384
Claire's birthday, day after...

659
01:06:47,467 --> 01:06:51,262
So you see, spectral transference
can only, uh, only work

660
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:54,599
if the vessel, um, you,

661
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:58,186
shares a birthday
with the deceased.

662
01:06:58,269 --> 01:07:01,773
The day after tomorrow
is my birthday.

663
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:06,361
Well, I'm afraid
you don't have much time, then.

664
01:07:07,946 --> 01:07:10,323
You see, what you must remember,

665
01:07:10,407 --> 01:07:16,371
in a world where the dead
walk among the living,

666
01:07:16,454 --> 01:07:18,957
nothing is as it seems.

667
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:30,593
There's a price to pay
for knowledge, I've learned.

668
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:32,679
Whoa. What are you doing?

669
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:35,390
The truth can
be an awful burden.

670
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:37,684
We're not gonna say anything.
I promise.

671
01:07:43,815 --> 01:07:47,986
This burden
is no longer mine.

672
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:50,196
Wait!
No, no!

673
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:05,754
Everything he said, I mean, the laws,
we have to tell everybody.

674
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:09,048
Ronnie, Ronnie, look,
Brian is coming for you. Okay?

675
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:11,551
What we need to do right now
is to keep you safe for the next 48 hours,

676
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:14,220
then maybe...
And then we'll tell everyone.

677
01:08:15,555 --> 01:08:17,640
Yeah.
What do we do?

678
01:08:17,724 --> 01:08:19,642
I don't have much time now.

679
01:08:19,726 --> 01:08:22,103
We can get you out of here,
go to my aunt's in Bakersfield.

680
01:08:22,187 --> 01:08:24,981
Yeah, but he could find us.
Rems stay in the same place.

681
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:27,817
Rems also aren't supposed
to communicate or change or murder.

682
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,778
I mean, you heard what Steiner said.
The laws are lies.

683
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:33,364
Look, Ronnie, stop,
I am on your side, okay?

684
01:08:33,448 --> 01:08:35,408
I'm just trying to figure
this out, the same as you.

685
01:08:35,492 --> 01:08:38,453
You think you're alone, you're not.
I'm with you. Okay?

686
01:08:39,746 --> 01:08:42,081
Mr. Lane?

687
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:45,627
Can you open your locker
for us, please?

688
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:50,256
What's this about?
Open the locker.

689
01:08:51,382 --> 01:08:53,134
Please.

690
01:08:58,264 --> 01:08:59,808
Step away
from the locker, Mr. Lane.

691
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:05,063
This is ridiculous. I don't know what you
think you're gonna find in there.

692
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:11,277
Whoa, no, no, no.
That's not mine.

693
01:09:12,362 --> 01:09:14,447
You're gonna have
to come with us, Mr. Lane.

694
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:16,533
This is ridiculous.
That's not mine. Hey! Wait!

695
01:09:16,616 --> 01:09:20,662
Easy! Okay, I'm sorry.
Ronnie, that's not my gun.

696
01:09:20,745 --> 01:09:23,456
Get the hell off me!
It's not mine. Ronnie!

697
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:47,230
Mr. Bittner! I'm in trouble
and I need you help. Okay?

698
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:48,314
I need you to listen to me.

699
01:09:48,398 --> 01:09:50,358
I know you're probably not gonna
believe me, but I just...

700
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:53,528
Ronnie, slow your roll.
I don't have anyone else to turn to.

701
01:09:54,946 --> 01:09:56,155
I believe you.

702
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:01,119
I believe you.

703
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:07,166
Pastor Greer told me everything.

704
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,168
Bill talked to her before he died.

705
01:10:09,252 --> 01:10:11,337
Do you think Brian
could have killed him?

706
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:13,464
I'm not sure. I started
doing my own digging.

707
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:15,633
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

708
01:10:15,717 --> 01:10:18,469
We have to tell Kirk. I mean,
he should be out by tonight.

709
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:20,138
You saw what just happened.

710
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:23,266
Well, yeah, but that wasn't his gun.

711
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:24,809
I shouldn't tell you this.

712
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:29,939
But you do know why Kirk was asked
to leave his last school, right?

713
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:34,193
No.
They found a gun on him.

714
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:43,077
So this was the Dr. Steiner?

715
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:46,080
And he didn't say anything else?
No. That was it.

716
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:50,960
If he's right, then running's
not gonna make a difference.

717
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:52,045
According to Steiner,

718
01:10:52,128 --> 01:10:55,423
this transference has to happen on the day
both of the vessels were born.

719
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,926
If it doesn't happen then,
it won't happen at all. Right?

720
01:10:58,009 --> 01:11:01,346
Mmhmm.
That means the 29th is Brian's window.

721
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:03,348
We'll just have
to keep you safe for 24 hours.

722
01:11:03,431 --> 01:11:05,475
How do we do that?
Well, do you have a panic room?

723
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:07,393
Yeah.

724
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:11,147
How would your mother
feel about a slight renovation?

725
01:11:20,907 --> 01:11:21,908
Hey.

726
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:26,371
Can I help?

727
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:28,706
We're good, thanks.

728
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:33,002
Ronnie, can I talk to you for a second?

729
01:11:34,295 --> 01:11:38,383
Please?
Yeah.

730
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:45,181
Why didn't you answer my calls? Huh?

731
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,933
Come on. You know
the gun wasn't mine.

732
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:50,979
How do I know that? Seriously?

733
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:53,982
Kirk, why did you get kicked
out of your last school?

734
01:11:56,526 --> 01:11:59,445
Please, just tell me the truth.
Ronnie. That was different.

735
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:00,571
Okay?

736
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:03,282
How was that different?
Because the gun was yours?

737
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:09,414
No, hey, Ronnie, please listen.

738
01:12:09,497 --> 01:12:13,418
Please listen to me. I was
never gonna hurt anyone.

739
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:16,587
Then why would you have it?
Because I was gonna hurt myself.

740
01:12:18,548 --> 01:12:22,135
Please, Ronnie. It was just a mistake.
You have to believe me.

741
01:12:24,303 --> 01:12:26,389
I... I don't know what to believe anymore.

742
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,642
Ronnie.

743
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:45,992
Hi. Anna Calder for Mr. Lawrence.
We talked on the phone.

744
01:12:46,075 --> 01:12:48,119
Have a seat, Ms. Calder.
Thank you.

745
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:55,293
We're gonna turn
that panic room

746
01:12:55,376 --> 01:12:59,047
into a shelter no remnant can get into.

747
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:09,807
The metal disrupts spectral energy,

748
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:12,101
which should make it harder
for Brian to pass through.

749
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:24,322
It's a sealant. Rems tend to emerge
more clearly in cooler climates.

750
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:26,532
You want to keep out the cold air.

751
01:13:30,787 --> 01:13:33,372
Don't worry, Ronnie,
we're going to keep Brian out.

752
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:37,835
It's ugly, but it should do the trick.

753
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:41,964
Yeah.

754
01:13:42,048 --> 01:13:44,634
Okay, we're gonna be here a while,
so I'll run out and get us some grub.

755
01:13:44,717 --> 01:13:48,137
You gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Yeah.

756
01:13:48,221 --> 01:13:51,140
Or you could come with me.
Oh, no, it's okay.

757
01:13:51,224 --> 01:13:54,102
I, um, I think I feel safer here.

758
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:57,355
Ronnie, it's going to be okay.

759
01:13:57,438 --> 01:13:59,273
You sure?

760
01:14:01,234 --> 01:14:02,860
No.

761
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:05,488
No, I'm actually
incredibly scared right now.

762
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,907
But if you stay strong for me,
that would be tremendous.

763
01:14:10,118 --> 01:14:11,994
Back in a flash.

764
01:14:34,684 --> 01:14:36,394
No, that's not possible.

765
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:42,775
Damn it, Ronnie!
Pick up the phone!

766
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:44,819
Shit!

767
01:14:55,163 --> 01:14:59,250
Mr. Lawrence, hi.
Ms., uh, Calder?

768
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,586
So nice to put the face to the voice.

769
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:04,005
Ms. Calder, I don't know
how to tell you this,

770
01:15:04,088 --> 01:15:07,133
but, uh, I've never spoken
with you before in my life.

771
01:15:14,432 --> 01:15:15,600
Come on!

772
01:16:52,405 --> 01:16:54,782
Dad!

773
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:06,836
Listen to me. It's Bittner.
He worked with Steiner.

774
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:10,506
His daughter died in The Event.
Bittner was Steiner's partner.

775
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:29,317
Eva! We've got to go now, baby!

776
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,652
Go to the bunkers,
just like we practiced!

777
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:34,405
Eva! Eva!

778
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:35,948
Eva! Eva!

779
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:39,869
Dad! Dad!

780
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:43,664
Dad! No! No!
Eva!

781
01:17:43,748 --> 01:17:46,167
No! Dad! Dad!

782
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,269
Ronnie.

783
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:20,993
Mr. Lane. This is a surprise.

784
01:18:21,077 --> 01:18:22,787
I just had a question
about the project.

785
01:19:13,838 --> 01:19:15,840
Man, is it ugly out there.

786
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:18,259
The storm's getting worse.

787
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:19,969
Brought food.

788
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:24,223
So what do we do now?
Well, we sit.

789
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:27,643
We eat. And we wait.

790
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:31,355
Oh, hey. You know
any good ghost stories?

791
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:55,337
Well... You got it?
That's okay. Yeah, I got it.

792
01:19:57,882 --> 01:20:00,050
Ow!
What happened?

793
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:01,469
Oh. Nothing, I just...
Oh.

794
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:03,387
I cut my finger.
Hang on.

795
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:13,564
What's this made out of anyway?
Lead.

796
01:20:16,442 --> 01:20:17,943
What kind of lead?

797
01:20:18,027 --> 01:20:21,113
Um, lead polymer. Let me
see that. Here, let me help.

798
01:20:21,197 --> 01:20:23,657
Okay, so we know Mary Greer.

799
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:26,785
We know this mystery guy,
he abducts her...

800
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:30,122
Strangles her.
...and then he kills her.

801
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:38,088
I never noticed that scar
on your face before.

802
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:40,299
How did you get that?
This one?

803
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,555
An accident.
What kind of accident?

804
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:52,645
Is something wrong, Ronnie?

805
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:59,610
In a world where the dead
walk among the living,

806
01:20:59,693 --> 01:21:02,738
nothing is as it seems.

807
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,329
I have to go to the bathroom.

808
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:14,625
I don't think now's a good time.

809
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,149
I'm doing
what any father would do, Ronnie.

810
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,987
Killing you is the only way
I can bring Eva back.

811
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,281
This your daughter?
Yeah, she's my angel.

812
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:46,699
No hug, no hello.

813
01:21:46,782 --> 01:21:49,868
It's spectral transference.
It didn't work with the others,

814
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:52,204
but it's your birthday,
and it can work with you.

815
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:06,677
You're her only chance, Ron.

816
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,638
I trusted you.

817
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,018
But I can't let Brian
stop me again this time.

818
01:22:15,728 --> 01:22:17,479
Or Pescatelli.

819
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:18,689
Or Kirk.

820
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:28,532
Each day I watch her vanish.

821
01:22:28,616 --> 01:22:31,327
That's the real sick joke
in all this, right?

822
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:34,413
Not that we lose
the people we love.

823
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:39,209
That we keep losing them
over and over.

824
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:42,630
A thousand times over.
I'm so sorry, Ronnie.

825
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:46,550
Eva deserves a chance.

826
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:54,642
So do I!

827
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:24,898
Ah!

828
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,740
A parent shouldn't bury their child.

829
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:34,575
Your father would have understood.

830
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:40,539
He would have understood. Please!

831
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:43,125
No! No!

832
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:50,377

You need to let go.

857

If you need me,
I'll always be right here.

859
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,853
It's time to let me go, Ron.

860
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:34,189
You need to let go.

861
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:46,451
Hey, hey! I got you!
Come here. Get up! I got you!

862
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:49,204
You'll be okay, Ronnie.
You'll be okay.

863
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:03,051
Help's on the way.
I thought you were dead.

864
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:05,721
I just got a little sidetracked.

865
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:09,141
Want to hear something amazing, though?
Something amazing happened.

866
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:10,642
Someone, uh...

867
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:14,980
someone found me. A remnant.

868
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:29,578
Dad. Dad!

869
01:29:32,873 --> 01:29:33,957
I found him, Ron.

870
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:39,379
I found him.
He was there the whole time.

871
01:29:39,463 --> 01:29:42,257
♪ Oh, you will all be well ♪

872
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,341
Some things are just meant to be.

873
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:48,013
Maybe not everything, but some things,
Ronnie? Some things are. Okay?

874
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:50,474
Yeah. Just don't let me go.

875
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,103
I won't. I'm not letting you go.

876
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:00,859
I'm never letting you go.

877
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:36,269
Brian never came back.

878
01:30:37,354 --> 01:30:38,355
You didn't either.

879
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:46,154
I guess you didn't need to anymore.

880
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:03,463
I love you, Dad.

881
01:31:18,603 --> 01:31:20,147
And I always will.

882
01:31:26,736 --> 01:31:27,863
Bye.

883
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:40,333
So?
So?

884
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:43,086
Remember what Steiner told us?
What we've seen,

885
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:46,923
we're probably the only two people alive
who actually know the truth.

886
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:48,258
What do we do now?

887
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:51,678
Steiner's dead. So is Bittner.

888
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:56,016
Nobody's going to believe us now.
I don't really know what we can do.

889
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:01,813
But... I know we
have to do something.

890
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:06,109

891
01:32:10,363 --> 01:32:12,115
