00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,454
(indistinct conversations)

00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,915
("The Oogum Boogum
Song" playing)

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,172
SIMON: I'm just like you.

4
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,466
For the most part,
my life is totally normal.

5
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,301
-Happy birthday.
-No!

6
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,679
SIMON: My dad was the annoyingly
handsome quarterback

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,639
who married
the hot valedictorian.

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,517
And, no, they didn't peak
in high school.

9
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,269
-(car door closes)
-(horn honks)

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,728
I have a sister
I actually like.

11
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,938
Not that I'd ever
tell her that.

12
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,691
And last year, and 200 episodes
of Chopped ago...

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,359
she decided
she wanted to be a chef.

14
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,987
Which means we're pretty much
all her test subjects now.

15
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,161
EMILY: Is it spicy, Jack?

16
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,164
-(spits)
-Oh! Gracious. Oh, my gosh.

17
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,791
SIMON: And then
there's my friends.

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,005
Two of them, I've known
since pretty much the beginning of time.

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,257
-Or at least kindergarten.
-No. No.

20
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,592
-LEAH: Oh! Sorry!
-Okay. How 'bout that?

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,468
(crowd cheering)

22
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,054
SIMON: One of them,
I just met a few months ago,

23
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,639
but it feels
like I've known her forever.

24
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,224
We do everything friends do.

25
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,101
We drink way too much
iced coffee,

26
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,478
watch bad '90s movies
and hang out at Waffle House

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,731
dreaming of college
and gorging on carbs.

28
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,691
(cheering continues)

29
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,329
SIMON: So, like I said.

30
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,581
I'm just like you.

31
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,125
I have a totally,
perfectly normal life.

32
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,130
Except I have
one huge-ass secret.

33
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,440
-(knocking on door)
-Hey! Morning! Oh!

34
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,400
-Hey!
-Sorry.

35
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,945
-I didn't realize you were masturbating.
-Yeah, very funny.

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,404
Your sister's downstairs
making some

37
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,573
la-di-da pancake thing
she saw on Top Chef,

38
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,075
so we should
probably go eat that.

39
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,785
Great. I'll be down
in just a second.

40
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,955
Okay. Right after you finish
searching the internet for...

41
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,541
lingerie photos of Gigi Habib?

42
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,126
(scoffs)
It's Hadid.

43
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,796
Right. I didn't realize
she was your girlfriend.

44
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,964
All right, finish up here.

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,383
You got me.

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,100
(indistinct chatter)

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,019
-Morning, guys.
-Simon, have a seat, honey.

48
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,312
-Morning, Simon.
-You gotta eat your breakfast.

49
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,272
Please don't tell me

50
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,065
that breakfast is the most
important meal of the day

51
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,067
because that is just so cliché.
You're better than that.

52
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,403
I was gonna say breakfast
lowers LDL cholesterol

53
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,280
and prevents
fluctuating glucose levels

54
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,781
-that lead to type two diabetes.
-Oh!

55
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,366
Touché.

56
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,202
Nora. These are incredible.

57
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,288
Cornmeal pancakes
with blackberry compote.

58
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,498
But they're not crumbly enough.

59
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,584
Stop it. They're perfect.

60
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,918
(Nora sighs)

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,919
Eat up, Bieber.

62
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,504
Okay, I didn't put very much powder--

63
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,839
-See you, guys.
-JACK: See you, Simon.

64
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,757
EMILY: Hey, honey. Be back
by seven! It's TV night.

65
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,934
(leaf blower whirs)

66
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,563
Hey!

67
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,148
Morning!

68
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,317
It's Simon! I live right here!

69
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,612
I like your boots!

70
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:00,991
Okay, bye!

71
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,998
-(sighs)
-(horn honks)

72
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,501
God damn.

73
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,597
("Rollercoaster" playing)

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,188
-Yo!
-Yo!

75
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,273
Had the craziest dream
last night.

76
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,234
Hey, Nick, you have the
craziest dream every night.

77
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,902
NICK: You don't understand.
I'm in this cave, right?

78
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,070
Or maybe it's in outer space.

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,655
David Beckham is there
with these two contact lenses

80
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,115
and then like, blue one or
red one, like he's a sexy

81
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,784
Morpheus from Matrix.

82
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,160
And I don't know
which one to pick.

83
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,745
I don't know what to do
with these things.

84
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,456
Oh, my God. Have you guys seen
CreekSecrets today?

85
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,542
First of all, you are obsessed
with that blog, so...

86
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,210
LEAH: Okay, but apparently,
Becca Peterson

87
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,088
got caught giving Ryan O'Donovan,
an HJ in the pool.

88
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,006
That's the real reason
they drained it.

89
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,050
-Man, our janitor needs a raise.
-LEAH: Oh, my God.

90
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,593
-And an HPV vaccine.
-(Nick laughs)

91
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,347
-NICK: Leah, I have this dream, right?
-LEAH: Nick, we have a rule, remember?

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,057
No analyzing dreams
before coffee.

93
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,396
Hi, could we get
four iced coffees, please?

94
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,189
Oh, could you get Abby's
with milk? She likes milk.

95
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,817
-One with milk.
-What are you, her barista?

96
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,195
(chuckles) It's not hard
to remember "with milk."

97
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,868
SIMON: Thank you.

98
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,334
ABBY: Hey!

99
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,547
-Hey.
-Hey.

100
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,216
(gasps) Oh, thank you.
I am figuratively dying.

101
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,302
So, Abby, last night I dreamt

102
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,845
I put the wrong contacts
in my eyes.

103
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,014
-Another dream. You're like...
-SIMON: Hmm.

104
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,601
You're like the love child of
Sigmund Freud and Cristiano Ronaldo.

105
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,269
-Oh, my God.
-Thanks.

106
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,104
Now, look. I can't see anything

107
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,689
and I'm stumbling around
in this cave,

108
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,025
crashing into stuff,
and then, I wake up.

109
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,068
-That's it?
-NICK: Yeah.

110
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,696
Maybe it's something that
you're not seeing clearly.

111
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,448
Like something that's, like,
right in front of your face.

112
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,366
What am I not seeing?

113
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,827
(exhales) No idea.

114
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,289
("Love me" playing)

115
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,834
Ooh! Ooh!

116
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,759
(indistinct chatter)

117
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,034
We should be hot Pokémon
for Halloween.

118
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,161
-Oh, yeah.
-But I get to be slutty Charmander.

119
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,621
Cool scarf, Ethan.

120
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,581
Hope it doesn't get caught
in your vagina.

121
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,667
Great choice on
the cargo pants, by the way.

122
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,961
It looks like you got
gangbanged by a T.J. Maxx.

123
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,504
Whatever, fag.
(laughs)

124
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,425
ETHAN (exhales): Honestly, it's just
not even a challenge anymore.

125
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,844
LEAH: Dicks.

126
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,720
Wish Ethan wouldn't make it
so easy for them.

127
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,138
Yeah, well, at my old school,

128
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,598
that would have been settled
with a knife fight.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,811
-(bell rings)
-Good morning, Creekwood High!

130
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,730
Come on, phones off!
There's a whole world to look at!

131
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,691
You can look people
in the eyes!

132
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,151
(groans)
Gah! Yeah.

133
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,820
Stop with the selfies.
You're not all that.

134
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,446
-I'll see you guys at lunch.
-Yeah.

135
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,074
Wow! Simonay.

136
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,701
Look at those new kicks,
my brother.

137
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,828
Where'd you get those? Where
could I get a pair of those?

138
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,162
-I forget. Sorry.
-You forget?

139
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,622
Come on, you gotta let me
know the brand!

140
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,124
I want to be sneaker brothers.

141
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,295
Oh, I see more phones!
Who took your phones now?

142
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,799
Me! Me! Me took your phones now!
You can get 'em at my office!

143
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,927
I can't believe we have to be
off book, in like, two weeks.

144
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,971
Seriously, Sally Bowles
never shuts the eff up.

145
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,681
SIMON: Don't you wish
you were talentless like me?

146
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,891
Here. Let me show you
a thing or two.

147
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,350
SIMON: Because then you could
just be living

148
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,935
the easy life as company member
number eight.

149
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,853
(Abby laughs)

150
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,813
Well, well, well...

151
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,524
If it isn't my fellow thespians.

152
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,318
Hey, Martin.

153
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,653
Hey, Spier. Hey, Abby.

154
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,030
Hi.

155
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,073
Excited to rehearse
with you later.

156
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,618
Hey, uh, so, fun fact.

157
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,913
You know that Cabaret was actually based
off a play called I Am Camera?

158
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:20,042
Then I Am a Camera was based off
this novel called Goodbye to Berlin.

159
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,085
And Goodbye to Berlin
was actually based off

160
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,545
Christopher Isherwood's

161
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,756
-early years in Berlin.
-(bell rings)

162
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,884
-Wow. That's awesome. I have homeroom.
-Yeah. All right.

163
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,470
-Well, I think she found that interesting.
-Bye, Martin.

164
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,554
Bye, big boy.
(chuckles)

165
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,975
Suraj! Now.

166
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,937
Come on. You know the drill.

167
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,690
EMILY: I've had an inspiration.
How about The Affair?

168
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,443
No. No. We cannot watch
The Affair as a family.

169
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,154
-Why not?
-Because it's all about sex.

170
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,657
Oh, well, God forbid we should
watch people make love.

171
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,533
Oh, God.

172
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,077
Oh, my God.
You guys are so repressed.

173
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,455
Don't therapize us, okay?
We are not your patients.

174
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,581
-We're your family.
-EMILY: That's true.

175
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,042
If you were my patients, you'd
be much more well-adjusted.

176
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,044
-Oh. Nice therapy burn, baby.
-Thank you.

177
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,338
-She got you.
-You know what?

178
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,131
We didn't see last week's
episode of The Bachelor.

179
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,050
How did that guy
even become the bachelor?

180
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,051
Why?

181
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,469
Well, he's clearly gay.

182
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,680
-NORA: No, he's not.
-Really?

183
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,722
-He's handsome.
-That date,

184
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,141
where he took the girl to
the "make your own perfume" place?

185
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,018
Dad! The producers
plan those dates.

186
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,103
He is so fruity.
He's so fruity.

187
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,397
He's a one-man pride parade.
Are you kidding me?

188
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,107
-He has more chemistry
-Just stop it.

189
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,442
with Chris Harrison,
than any of those girls.

190
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,696
(whispers) After this, I gotta
show you something.

191
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,739
Okay?
Let's watch The Americans.

192
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,616
EMILY: Every single episode,
you here next to me.

193
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,410
So your mother decided
that we should make

194
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,953
each other anniversary
presents this year.

195
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,330
You know, so they came
from the heart, or some crap.

196
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,749
Anyway, I decided to come up
with this bad boy.

197
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,750
Look at this.

198
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,545
I present to you,
a Jack Spier production.

199
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,046
-(mouse clicks)
-("Heaven" playing)

200
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,259
Wait, wait.

201
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,052
Look at that!

202
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,138
Oh, it's so good.

203
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,103
Look at this.
Wait, wait, wait.

204
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,316
SIMON: Yup. Okay.

205
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,442
(stops video)

206
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,818
What are you...

207
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,654
Look, this is your
20th anniversary,

208
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,364
so I'm gonna be super real
with you right now.

209
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,783
This looks
like a fourth grader made it.

210
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,203
And not even the smartest
fourth grader in the class.

211
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,121
Just, like,
a deeply average fourth grader.

212
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,831
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

213
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,000
I got fade-ins.
I got dissolves.

214
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,710
-This is beautiful.
-Get up for a second.

215
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,128
I'll help you. Trust me.

216
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,047
We can make this good.
We just gotta put in...

217
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,424
you know, some home video.

218
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,802
Maybe put in some better music.

219
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,347
"Better music"? This was huge
when we were young.

220
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,766
Yeah. So was Bill Cosby.

221
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,851
("Waterloo Sunset" playing)

222
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,776
(cell phone ringing)

223
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,697
-Hey.
-Have you seen the new post?

224
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,407
No. What? Oh, my God.

225
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,867
You know, I'm never getting
back in that pool again.

226
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,161
Wait, no. About the closeted
gay kid at school.

227
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,123
What?

228
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,167
LEAH:
Yeah, it's on CreekSecrets.

229
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,679
-LEAH: Who do you think it is?
-(exhales)

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,431
I bet it's that sophomore
with the rimless glasses. I get a vibe.

231
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,183
-Actually.
-Hmm.

232
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,935
Maybe it's Parker O'Malley.

233
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,020
I've heard he's, like,
obsessed with Les Mis.

234
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,730
Oh, gosh. Jeez. I gotta go.

235
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,566
Bieber just took a dump
on the floor.

236
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,733
LEAH: Aw, Beebs.

237
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,026
-Feed him some rice...
-Can I call you back?

238
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,408
SIMON: "Sometimes, I feel like
I'm stuck on a Ferris wheel.

239
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,953
One minute I'm on top of the world,
and the next, I'm at rock bottom.

240
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,330
Over and over, all day long.

241
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,750
Because a lot of my life is great,
but nobody knows I'm gay.

242
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,335
Blue."

243
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,296
(exhales)

244
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,422
(clears throat)

245
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,221
Blue. Okay.

246
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,681
(exhales)

247
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,900
SIMON: Dear Blue,
I'm just like you.

248
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,069
For the most part,
my life is totally normal.

249
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,029
My dad was the annoyingly
handsome quarterback

250
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,365
who married the hot valedictorian.
And no, they didn't peak in high school.

251
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,367
I have a sister I actually like.
Not that I'd ever tell her that.

252
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,285
And then, there's my friends.

253
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,579
We do everything friends do.
We drink way too much...

254
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,498
So, like I said,
I'm just like you.

255
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,084
I have a totally,
perfectly normal life.

256
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,503
Except I have one
huge-ass secret.

257
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,529
Jacques.

258
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,293
(panting)

259
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,545
Hey. Morning.

260
00:13:59,089 --> 00:13:59,965
(cell phone chimes)

261
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,101
(sighs)

262
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,103
Nothin'.

263
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,026
TEACHER: Math is what
we're talking about.

264
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,029
Can anyone answer for me
how we find the value

265
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,991
of "d-y by d-x" that I have
written up on the board?

266
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,744
Does anyone want to...
Yes! Simon.

267
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,871
Can I go to the bathroom?

268
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,998
Sure, it's fine.

269
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,041
Thanks.

270
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,772
(sighs)

271
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,526
Simon. Simon.

272
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,153
-Yeah.
-Can I get some fries?

273
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,489
-Oh, yeah.
-BRAM: Yeah? Thanks.

274
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,616
GARRETT: I'm telling you,
the Oakwood Tigers

275
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,576
score so many goals
because they shave their legs.

276
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,370
Garrett, I'm not gonna
shave my legs.

277
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,539
It makes their kicks
more aerodynamic.

278
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,750
-We can just do extra burpees, man.
-Whatever, Bram.

279
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,462
Guys, I just found
a press-on nail in my salad.

280
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,881
BOTH: Debbie.

281
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,716
(indistinct chatter)

282
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,596
Why is there no cell reception
at this school?

283
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,265
I swear to God.

284
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,232
-Simonay, Simonay.
-Hey.

285
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,276
What are you doing?
You can't text in the halls.

286
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,610
How many times
have I told you that?

287
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,405
I can't have all my students
Tindering it up. That's my department.

288
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,614
-Right.
-(laughing)

289
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,740
It actually is.

290
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,617
I got a really hot date
on Tinder tonight.

291
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,202
She is cute!

292
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,915
"Ew! Vice principals can't go
on dates. That's gross."

293
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,292
We're people too, Simon.

294
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,544
We like to go out.
We like to have a good time.

295
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,462
We like to have sex.
That's not a big deal, right?

296
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,839
Yeah, no. No biggie at all.

297
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,507
Actually. You know,
I totally see you as a person.

298
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,800
-Thank you. I appreciate that.
-Yeah.

299
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,177
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

300
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,511
-Seriously.
-Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,679
Could I just get my phone though?

302
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,182
No. Unfortunately, I'm gonna
have to keep it until after play practice.

303
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,766
But you will get your precious

304
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,393
after play practice, okay?
I promise.

305
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,103
So how's play practice going?

306
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,022
-SIMON: Great. Yeah, it's...

343
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,880
Oy, yoy, yoy, yoy, yo!

344
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,007
-Mr. Worth.
-Hey, what's up, my brother?

345
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,633
Hey, just here for my phone.

346
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,844
Oh, of course you are.
Of course you are.

347
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,387
How'd you enjoy
being unplugged?

348
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,346
It was great.

349
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,639
-Great, right?
-Yeah.

350
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,474
This isn't life, man.
This is plugged.

351
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,059
-This is unplugged.
-Mm-hmm.

352
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,645
-Plugged. Unplugged.
-Yep.

353
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,106
All right, Simon, I know that
I'm hard on you. I really do.

354
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,274
SIMON: Mm-hmm.

355
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,902
But it's only 'cause I really
see myself in you.

356
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,821
Uh... You know, I don't know
if I'd say that.

357
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,948
No, I see it, it's obvious.
It's obvious.

358
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,200
I know there's a lot

359
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,993
-going on there, man.
-Yup.

360
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,913
And I bet you got a lot of questions.
Is there something you wanna say to me?

361
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,124
-No.
-You know my policy. What does it say?

362
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,627
-"Open door. Open ears."
-"Open door. Open ears."

363
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,921
There's nothing
you want to say?

364
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,631
-Nope.
-You sure?

365
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:51,924
-Yeah.
-Okay.

366
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,342
-It's a great sign though.
-Thank you.

367
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,344
Thank you. Now don't text and drive.
That's how my cat got murdered.

368
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,679
-Okay.
-(laughs)

369
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,057
I'm just kidding.
I don't have cats. I got asthma.

370
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,156
(sighs)

371
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,535
BLUE: A secret, huh?

372
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,286
Is it the same as my secret?

373
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,747
If it is, when did you know?

374
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,542
-Have you told anyone? Blue.
-(horn honking)

375
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:29,753
Okay.

376
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,352
SIMON: No, Blue.
I haven't told anyone.

377
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,230
And, honestly, I can't even
really explain why.

378
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,067
Deep down, I know my family
would be fine with it.

379
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,194
Hey, what rhymes
with "patriarchy"?

380
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,363
That says "patriachy" though.

381
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,073
Oh, shit.

382
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,201
SIMON: My mom's about
as liberal as they come.

383
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,912
And my dad isn't exactly
the macho type.

384
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,292
I mean, Creekwood's resident
out-gay kid seems to be doing just fine.

385
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,294
When Ethan came out,
no one even cared.

386
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,880
Guys, I have something
to tell you.

387
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,673
I'm gay.

388
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,844
Wow, really?
That's really great, Ethan.

389
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,637
Oh, my God. No way.

390
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,765
Oh, my God, you are?
I had no idea.

391
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,684
What a complete surprise!

392
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,935
Too much, Claire.

393
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,229
SIMON: As for how I knew
I was gay,

394
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,023
it was a bunch of
little things.

395
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,400
Like this one recurring dream

396
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,277
I kept having
about Daniel Radcliffe.

397
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,327
And then proceeded to have
every night for a month.

398
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,585
I was obsessed
with Panic! at the Disco.

399
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,421
I can't. He's so cute.
He's so cute.

400
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,714
(clears throat)

401
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,216
Come on,
he's like Jesus and chocolate.

402
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,259
Just look at him.

403
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,845
SIMON: Then I realized
it really wasn't about the music.

404
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,181
And then there was
my first girlfriend.

405
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,766
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

406
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,352
Wow. Thank you. Be right back.

407
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,315
Wasn't my proudest moment.

408
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,492
How 'bout you?
How did you know?

409
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,619
Warmly, Jacques.

410
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:31,667
Fondly, Jacques.

411
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,298
Jacques.

412
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,139
(cell phone chimes)

413
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,771
BLUE: Jacques, don't worry.

414
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,731
If your proudest moment
happened in middle school,

415
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,149
that would be pretty sad.

416
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,151
For me, I realized I liked guys

417
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,152
watching Game of Thrones.

418
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,362
My friends were all
holding their breath

419
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,240
waiting to see
the Dragon Princess's boobs.

420
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,993
I was crushing hard
on Jon Snow.

421
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,412
SIMON: Well,
I've never told anyone

422
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,123
about my Daniel Radcliffe phase
so now we're even.

423
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,126
And for the record, I think Jon Snow
is an excellent choice

424
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,335
for your sexual awakening.

425
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,087
So I guess, if I want
to find you at school

426
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,173
I just have to look for
the Game of Thrones fanatic.

427
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,019
Wow.

428
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,229
I was just listening to that
M83 song "Reunion,"

429
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,564
and it made me think of you.

430
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,941
BLUE: You'll probably think
my music taste is lame.

431
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,027
Kind of have the same taste
as my Aunt Sally

432
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,612
who loves show tunes.

433
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,697
Obviously, some of the things
I've told you about myself

434
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:46,325
are things I've never
talked about with anyone.

435
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:48,994
There's something about you
that makes me want to open up.

436
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,079
And that's
slightly terrifying for me.

437
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,832
SIMON: So I've been thinking,
maybe I should be Jon Snow for Halloween.

438
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,043
What about you?
Who are you gonna be?

439
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,672
BLUE: I'm not dressing up.
For me, Halloween's all about the Oreos

440
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,382
with the orange frosting
in the middle.

441
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,053
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey.

442
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,514
Wow. Look at that smile.
You're glowing, man.

443
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,557
-No.
-You are glowing. You look happy.

444
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,642
Oh, just regular.

445
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:12,726
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

446
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,020
Me too. I'm a little meh.

447
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,272
Why "meh"?

448
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,984
Oh, I had my big Tinder date
last night. Oh, God.

449
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,945
She was not into it.
(chuckles)

450
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,530
At. All.

451
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,406
(bell ringing)

452
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,991
-Oh, come on. Too soon.
-No.

453
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,535
The bell is a buzzkill.

454
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,786
-See you, Mr. Worth.
-All right.

455
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:33,455
(Simon sighs)

456
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,957
Well, thank you
for your help, Fräulein.

457
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:35,874
You're welcome.

458
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,586
German accent for Cabaret.
Yup. Take care, Ms. Bradley.

459
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:41,922
Ladies.

460
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:46,218
Let's see what you got,
interwebs.

461
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,686
LEAH: Here are your burnt tots,
because you have horrible taste.

462
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:57,813
SIMON: Here's your green banana,

463
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,147
because you like disgusting things.

464
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,691
-LEAH: Mm-hm.
-Wow, you guys are weird.

465
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,443
Yup. They're practically
Cantonese twins.

466
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,529
-Siamese.
-Yeah. Siamese.

467
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,114
Yeah, agree to disagree.

468
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,408
I don't think that's one of those things
where you can agree to disagree.

469
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,325
-...disagree.
-It's just right.

470
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,785
NICK: To each his own.

471
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,204
BRAM: Oreos.

472
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,456
Man, I love those.

473
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,168
-Halloween ones are the best, right?
-Yeah.

474
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,129
Er, so, guys, I have great news.

475
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,507
My aunt's boyfriend just took off
with her car and all her jewelry.

476
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,134
Bram, that's terrible news!

477
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,303
I know, but it's like,
the third time it's happened to her.

478
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,888
She has really bad taste in men.

479
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,100
Anyways, my mom is going down
to Orlando to deal with it

480
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,978
which means I get to throw
a Halloween party.

481
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:39,980
-Awesome!
-Yay!

482
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,064
Nice!

483
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,941
Thank you,
Bram's dumb-ass aunt!

484
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,276
All right, this is
gonna be epic, you guys.

485
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,236
I can bring
my karaoke machine.

486
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,530
All right, hey, guys,
Halloween party Friday night!

487
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,282
Friday night, Halloween party,
okay? Bram's house!

488
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,242
-You really set this in motion, man.
-I know, right?

489
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,077
-Hey, little guy.
-Me?

490
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,705
Halloween party. Friday night.
Bram's house. Be there.

491
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,248
-You're gonna freak him out, man.
-GARRETT: Yeah.

492
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,083
LEAH: I know.
He's, like, nine years old.

493
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,802
BLUE: Very relieved that
we're in agreement on Oreos.

494
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,971
That would have been
a deal-breaker for me.

495
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:17,309
On a totally different,
non-cookie related note...

496
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,562
is it weird that I have no idea
what you look like,

497
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,565
but I can't stop thinking
about kissing you.

498
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,486
TEACHER: Simon. Simon.

499
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,947
Eyes on your own test.

500
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,667
Don't stop on my account,
Rob and Brianne.

501
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,418
That's the most action
I've seen in weeks.

502
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,880
What do we got here? Ah!
When we're done, it's gonna look

503
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,675
like a real German sex club.
Don't ask me how I know.

504
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,968
(laughs)

505
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,180
Hey! Hey! The spray paint
is for painting, not for huffing.

506
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,057
You don't want
to get good at that.

507
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,184
Okay, do you guys think
I should dye my hair grey

508
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,311
-to play Fräulein Schneider?
-Sure.

509
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,938
TAYLOR: Really? But my hair
is kind of like my thing.

510
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,147
I'm gonna go get a soda.

511
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,566
Do you want anything?

512
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,026
-No.
-MS. ALBRIGHT: You disgust me.

513
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,996
Simon! Hey, hey, hey.

514
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,372
-Hey, Martin.
-Buddy.

515
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,959
Hey, um, I used the computer
in the library right after you.

516
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,086
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

517
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,715
Well, I went to Gmail,
and it pulled up your account.

518
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,009
And I, uh, read
some of your emails.

519
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,260
I know
I probably shouldn't've,

520
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,012
but they were, like,
right there. (chuckles)

521
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,222
So you'll be interested
to know my brother's gay.

522
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,021
No. Martin, that wouldn't
interest me to know.

523
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,106
Okay. Don't worry.
I won't show anyone.

524
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,609
Show anyone what?

525
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,905
Did you print my emails
or something?

526
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,781
Oh, no, no. (chuckles)

527
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,950
I screenshot them.

528
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,369
-You screenshotted my emails?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

529
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,662
Let me talk to you for a second.

530
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,874
-Oh, Ms. Bradley.
-MS. BRADLEY: Hello, Martin.

531
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,293
-Did you feather your hair?
-No, Martin. Shh.

532
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,544
MARTIN: Looking good, huh?

533
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:09,421
This is a good section.

534
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:11,757
MARTIN: Jeez.

535
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,510
Now, why the hell
did you screenshot my emails?

536
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,888
Ah, well, you and Abby Susso
are good friends. Right?

537
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,057
Yeah. We know each other.
What does that have to do with anything?

538
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,976
Well, I need you to help me
talk with her...

539
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,270
and hang out with her
and stuff, you know?

540
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,939
Why would I help you do that?

541
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,192
Are you blackmailing me?

542
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,070
Oh, shh! Okay. Don't be
so dramatic here, Simon.

543
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,154
SIMON: Sup, Tyler?

544
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:36,114
MARTIN: What's up, Tyler?
Is that a Patagonia?

545
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,368
Nice. I just like her.

546
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,454
And I think
that you could help me.

547
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,832
Yeah, what if I say no, Martin?
I mean, what are you gonna do?

548
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,084
You gonna tell the whole school
that I'm...

549
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,253
You're gonna leak my emails?

550
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,963
You're gonna post 'em
on CreekSecrets?

551
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,881
I just think
that we're in a position here,

552
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,092
where we could help
each other out is all.

553
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,219
So think about it.

554
00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,137
Good talk.

555
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,981
You know, I never thought
of a pepper

556
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,274
-as being a vegetable...
-(cell phone chimes)

557
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,316
...but it makes perfect sense.

558
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,945
EMILY: I like the cilantro.
A little Mexican flair, huh?

559
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,196
JACK: Very creative, kiddo.

560
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,824
You hate the peppers.
Don't you?

561
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,285
No. The peppers are great.

562
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:23,912
I'm just gonna get some air.

563
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,676
BRAM: Jacques, I have to get
something off my chest.

564
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,596
The other day, you asked me
what I was wearing for Halloween

565
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,848
and I said
I wasn't dressing up.

566
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,100
I lied. Truth is,

567
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,852
I didn't want you to know
what I was wearing

568
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:49,021
because I don't want you
to know who I am.

569
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,234
Right now, these emails,
they feel like this totally safe place.

570
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,945
I'm just not ready
for my whole world to change.

571
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,488
I hope you understand.

572
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,532
(indistinct conversation)

573
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,665
SIMON: Yes, Blue. I understand.

574
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,058
(sniffing)

575
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,727
Okay, if you want me
to help you with Abby,

576
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:29,770
you cannot eat that.

577
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,355
So you're gonna help me?

578
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:32,773
Yeah.

579
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,067
(chuckles)

580
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,946
Simon, that is fantastic news.

581
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,031
I really think that Abby and I
are meant to be together.

582
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,407
-Really? Do you?
-Mm-hmm.

583
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,825
It's not all about looks, Simon.

584
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,328
Okay. So you're banking
on your great,

585
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,455
blackmaily personality
to get the job done?

586
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,582
-Where are we going?
-Your place.

587
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:51,834
We're gonna see
if you have anything

588
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,335
that doesn't scream,
"punch me."

589
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,254
Actually, I've got swim lessons.

590
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,755
Cancel it!

591
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,883
MARTIN: Okay, I just have to
call my mom first.

592
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,010
She has to approve everybody
that comes in the house.

593
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,055
All right. Here we go.

594
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,184
All right. And here we are.

595
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,855
-This is where the magic happens.
-Wow.

596
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,649
Ooh. Correction. (chuckles)

597
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,443
This is where the magic happens.

598
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,822
I've been dabbling
in close-up illusions.

599
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,240
Does Abby like magic?

600
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,534
No. Martin, I don't think
she does like magic.

601
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,160
But, um,
there's a really thin line

602
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,997
between laughing with someone,
and laughing at someone.

603
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:31,790
And you are that line.

604
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:34,626
So, if you want Abby to like you,
what you have to do is you have to

605
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,379
-make her see you as more of a...
-As sexy Martin!

606
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,257
Yeah! Yeah, I could be sexy.

607
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,386
You like dudes. Tell me.

608
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,138
What part of me
do you find the hottest?

609
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,182
-No. I'm not doing this.
-No. Come on.

610
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,683
No, Martin.
I don't want to answer that.

611
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:53,437
Look, if you said my shoulders
I would dress to accentuate. You know?

612
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,439
You know what?
Here's your first tip.

613
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:56,732
Ripped.

614
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,027
Girls, they don't want
to read your clothes.

615
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,320
I think you're wrong
about that one.

616
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,989
-How many of these do you have?
-Hey, can you--

617
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:07,367
Please, just stop! Hey! Stop!

618
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,245
Look, I don't want your help
in changing me.

619
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,333
I want your help in getting
Abby to like me for me.

620
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,045
Look. Um...

621
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,925
there's a party this Saturday.
At Bram's.

622
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,346
Do you want to go
with my friends and I?

623
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,680
Yes!

624
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,141
Yes! So simple.

625
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,560
Must be why
they call you Simple Simon.

626
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,354
Nobody calls me that, Martin.

627
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,732
Hey, uh, do you want to,
like, sleep over?

628
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:40,150
SIMON: Nope.

629
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:51,537
Oh, hello.

630
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,539
Hey, what's up?

631
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,873
-Nice, right?
-LEAH: Nick.

632
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:55,874
Good?

633
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,168
This is, like, a new level of
laziness, even for you.

634
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,879
What do you mean?
I'm Cristiano Ronaldo.

635
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:01,964
And you couldn't
even be bothered

636
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,340
to fill in the letters
on the back?

637
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,592
No, come on. Give me that.

638
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,971
-You are a bully.
-(laughs)

639
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,266
(In a British accent) Hey. Don't
talk about Yoko that way, man.

640
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:14,852
Because if you do,
you're out of the band.

641
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,186
Who are you guys
supposed to be?

642
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:19,439
John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

643
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,109
Oh! I thought she was the girl
from The Ring,

644
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,443
and you were Jesus.

645
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,613
Jesus? No. Why would Jesus be
wearing a white suit?

646
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:27,990
I don't know. You tell me.

647
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:29,992
You're the one who decided to
dress up like fancy Jesus.

648
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,451
Oh, my God. Okay. Come here.

649
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:32,744
-Turn around.
-I'm here.

650
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:33,662
-Turn around.
-Okay.

651
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,540
-Okay. Way better.
-Is it good? Is it?

652
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah. Now, we need to do
something about this hair.

653
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,209
Maybe slick it back?

654
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,044
NICK: It doesn't do that.
It doesn't slick back.

655
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:42,921
Wonder Woman in the hizzy!

656
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:43,964
NICK: Hi!

657
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:47,217
I made up a catchphrase,
'cause Wonder Woman doesn't have one.

658
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:49,678
"Hizzy" means house.

659
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,054
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

660
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,097
-Right. Yeah.
-Yeah.

661
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,308
Oh, Abby, you look amazing.

662
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,475
Thank you!

663
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,145
Yeah. You look awesome.

664
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:00,606
I'm gonna go make
those frozen pizzas.

665
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,358
-NICK: All right.
-Yeah, I'll help.

666
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:06,737
That's a nice costume, for real.

667
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,031
Thank you.
What? Cristiano Ronaldo!

668
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:09,948
Nailed it.

669
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,452
Do you remember when we went to school
dressed as Charlie's Angels?

670
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,912
Oh, my God, yes.

671
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:16,580
And Nick's balls fell out
of his booty shorts

672
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,123
when he, like, dropped down
to do the gun pose?

673
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,710
Mm. Do you miss
trick-or-treating?

674
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,962
What, you mean instead of, like,
going to loud parties

675
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,590
pretending to like the taste of beer
and feeling too self-conscious to dance?

676
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:28,800
I don't know why
you feel self-conscious.

677
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:32,679
I mean, you are very clearly
the coolest person at our school.

678
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,350
I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who feels that way.

679
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:38,477
But thank you.

680
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:43,273
(doorbell ringing)

681
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,275
Who's that?

682
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,236
I invited Martin.

683
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,154
-Martin Addison?
-(groans) Why?

684
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,697
Is this a Make-A-Wish situation?

685
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,533
(doorbell continues ringing)

686
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,617
No, he's cool.

687
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,662
Hey.

688
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,122
Oh, looking sharp.

689
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,666
What the...

690
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,876
-MARTIN: Guys.
-What are you supposed to be?

691
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,294
Isn't it obvious?

692
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,256
Ah! I'm a Freudian slip.

693
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,635
Abby. Wonder Woman.

694
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,431
NICK: Just pick a song already.

695
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,018
Hey, Nick, uh,
can you not rush me?

696
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,311
(laughing)

697
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,355
ABBY: Honestly, I can't
choose. There's so many.

698
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,313
That's like Netflix.

699
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,400
You know, trying to pick
a film on Netflix.

700
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:29,695
I'm like... (groans)
"Am I in an Apatow mood,

701
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,322
or am I in a Billy Wilder
mood?" You know?

702
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,449
Ooh, play Drake. Yes.

703
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,411
Uh, no. Drake is, like,
super played out at this point.

704
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,289
You can't play out a rap god.
Doesn't happen.

705
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,498
-Impossible.
-First of all, he's not a rap god.

706
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,626
And second of all,
I'm looking for some Beyoncé.

707
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,170
-Oh.
-I just can't find "Lemonade."

708
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,045
Hey. Here's an
interesting question.

709
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,005
I love Beyoncé.

710
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,091
-What makes you guys feel nostalgic?
-You do?

711
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,634
I mean, I think everybody
kinda likes Beyoncé.

712
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,554
Mine's grape soda makes me
feel very nostalgic.

713
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,806
-What are you talking about?
-What makes you feel nostalgic?

714
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,349
Hey, Abby.

715
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,518
I bet you're gonna have
the best costume tonight.

716
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,188
-Thanks.
-Nah, you're welcome.

717
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,440
(Martin mocking)

718
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,443
What the hell, Spier?

719
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,820
Hey, why is Nick
still flirting with Abby?

720
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,781
SIMON: I don't know, Martin.
Maybe you shouldn't have worn a dress.

721
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,493
You look like a drag queen
rolled around in magnetic poetry.

722
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,163
(music playing)

723
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,372
Hey, Abby!

724
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,458
Whenever you need a refill
of your drink,

725
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,168
I'll be
your designated bartender.

726
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,169
So don't worry.

727
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,463
Okay. Hey, Chloe, come here!

728
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,089
Yo, yo, yo!

729
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,842
Hey. John Lennon?

730
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,260
-Yeah. You got it.
-Nice.

731
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,346
And, um, Nick you're...

732
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:41,558
-You're Nick.
-No. No. I'm Ronaldo.

733
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,393
-Oh. My bad.
-Obviously.

734
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:44,603
Who are you supposed to be?

735
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,273
Oh. Uh... I am post-presidency
Barack Obama.

736
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,734
So I'm just chillin' in
Hawaii, drinking Mai Tais,

737
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:54,029
writing memoirs and hoping
Trump doesn't destroy my legacy.

738
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:56,156
-(both chuckle)
-That's awesome.

739
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,992
Thanks. Now let's go
to the bar. Come on.

740
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,369
BOTH: Yeah.

741
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,370
Hell yeah.

No, thanks. I'm driving.

750
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,596
-And Simon doesn't really drink.
-No, I drink. It's cool. I drink.

751
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,056
-All right, that's my man.
-NICK: Really?

752
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,433
You wouldn't even have a glass
of Manischewitz at Leah's Seder.

753
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:25,811
No, it's Halloween, man.
It's a special occasion.

754
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:27,437
True that.

755
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,106

-You okay?
-(coughing)

("Never Fall in Love" playing)

759
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,033
You're good at this.
You got this.

760
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:48,000
Abby is the hottest
Wonder Woman I have ever seen.

761
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,959
SIMON: Yeah.

762
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,669
The shit that I would let her
do to me with that lasso.

763
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,129
Oh, I know, man.

764
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,548
Just, like, tie me up
with that thing.

765
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,091
You're not into Abby, are you?

766
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,467
No, no, no.

767
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,761
I mean, it's not like I...
She's cute...

768
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,847
-Yeah.
-...but she's just not really my type.

769
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,226
Not because she's black.
I love black women.

770
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,770
Not like, you know, I have
a thing for black women,

771
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,647
I just love all women.

772
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,985
MARTIN (laughs): Oh, oh. Oh!
-Oh!

773
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:18,530
-Oh, hey.
-Hey! Oh, hey.

774
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,783
Hey. Mm.

775
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:25,662
-I'm gonna go ask her out.
-What? No.

776
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,664
-No? No?
-No.

777
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,249
-You can't ask Abby out.
-Why not?

778
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:34,129
Because. She didn't tell you
about Jonathan?

779
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,422
She didn't tell you about that?

780
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:36,423
-No.
-He's older.

781
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,759
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-In college.

782
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,469
He's really experienced.

783
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,557
-You know I've only had sex once, right?
-I know that.

784
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,851
You know, it's like no one tells you
how dark everything is

785
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,479
and how slippery everything
gets, and, you know,

786
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,731
the parts you think are the right parts
are actually the wrong parts and...

787
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,735
All right, I'm gonna go eat
my feelings away. (laughs)

788
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,029
Man, I'm sorry...

789
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,447
NICK: No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

790
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,825
Whoa, whoa.

791
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,957
-BRAM: Hey, Simon!
-Hey.

792
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,250
Hey, you wanna play Beirut?

793
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:12,584
Yeah. Sure.

794
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,378
We just need two more people.

795
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,755
How about you and me,
and then, um...

796
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,674
Let me pour. I insist.

797
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:19,967
Abby and Martin?

798
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:22,135
-BRAM: Okay, cool.
-SIMON: Hey, Martin.

799
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,178
-MARTIN: Yeah.
-SIMON: Abby.

800
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:24,513
Let's play Beirut.

801
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,265
-No, I don't...
-Yeah. Let's do it.

802
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,934
Come on, let's go.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

803
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,894
Good old competition.
(chuckles)

804
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,855
-Ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

805
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,691
Beirut. Right?

806
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:36,817
-Yes!
-(sighs)

807
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,527
Okay. Have you ever played
Beirut before?

808
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,112
Uh, totally. Yeah.

809
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:44,032
Great. All right, so,
two reracks, no blowing

810
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,243
and two balls in the cup means
that you have to take three, okay?

811
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:47,327
Okay. Cool.

812
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,830
I thought we were talking
about a different game.

813
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,290
We'll just explain
as we go. Okay?

814
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,207
-Yeah.
-Okay. Got it.

815
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:53,375
SIMON: Ready?

816
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,669
-Maybe you should take these...
-Oh.

817
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,214
-You'll see better. Right?
-Good idea. Yeah.

818
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,800
-All you.
-Raindrop!

819
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,802
MARTIN: Here we go, all right.
You got this one.

820
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,220
Oh, is that...
This is mine to drink?

821
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:08,682
God.

822
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:10,851
Oh!

00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:13,645

(imitates explosion)

826
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,067
Do we need a handshake?
Is that...

827
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:21,904
You get one of these in
and we can totally have a handshake.

828
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:23,906
Fly it away. Fly it away.

829
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,034

00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:58,709
-I'm starting to get so tired!
-I am so tired.

853
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,048
Hey, Martin, not now, man.
All right? I've had a big night.

854
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,177
Oh!

855
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,846
Really? Really?

856
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,016
(groans) I'm sorry.

857
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,642
-Come on!
-(Martin coughing)

858
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,147
-LEAH: What are you doing?
-I don't know.

859
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,399
(Leah sighs)

860
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,818
♪ Willkommen ♪

861
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,362
-Are you serious?
-♪ Bienvenue ♪

862
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,991
♪ Welcome... ♪
Whoa. Careful.

863
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,118
(laughs) Okay, come on.
We gotta get you home.

864
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,499
-Look, we're so close!
-Oh, my God!

865
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,417
Wait, what?

866
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,295
-Dude, my parents are still up.
-Oh, God.

867
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,005
-Oh...
-Okay, you know what... Come on.

868
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,883
I need you to think of
something really sad...

869
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:48,842
Uh-huh.

870
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,011
Like, the documentary
about how all the whales

871
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,930
-hate living at SeaWorld.
-Too sad!

872
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,224
God. Okay, then just, you know what,
don't say anything at all...

873
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:57,684
And we'll ditch the barf shirt
till tomorrow.

874
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,602
SIMON: Okay.

875
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:00,979
-LEAH: Si?
-SIMON: Yeah.

876
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,107
LEAH: Just as little as possible,
say as little as possible.

877
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:08,153
(door creaks)

878
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:14,535
EMILY: So how does that work?

879
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:16,370
I know, I remember
when I went to...

880
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:17,788
Hey, guys!

881
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,415
-Hey!
-Hey!

882
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,000
-Come talk to us.
-Hey!

883
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,877
-How was the party?
-It was really fun.

884
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:25,504
-Was it?
-Yeah.

885
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:26,421
Aces.

886
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,758
BOTH: Huh. (chuckling)

887
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,512
Uh, well. Thanks for
letting me stay over.

888
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,055
-JACK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-EMILY: Yeah.

889
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,140
You've been
staying over 10 years.

890
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:38,892
You don't have to thank us.

891
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:40,811
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

892
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,938
(whispers) Stop. Shh!

893
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,443
John Lennon was wearing
a woman's sweater.

894
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,945
-Mm.
-And he's drunk.

895
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:51,947
-Definitely.
-So how do we feel about that?

896
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:55,284
Well, he didn't drive drunk,
and he's home before curfew, so...

897
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:58,245
Good. That's what I thought
we thought.

898
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,997
Yeah, that's what
we think, right?

899
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,456
-Yeah. We're good parents.
-Yeah, we're good parents.

900
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:02,833
Right?

901
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,335
(slow music playing)

902
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:08,505
The room stopped spinning.

903
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:21,226
Do you ever feel weird?

904
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:25,272
-Weird?
-Yeah.

905
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:30,777
Sometimes I feel like
I'm always on the outside.

906
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:35,866
What do you mean?

907
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,160
Like tonight, you know...

908
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,829
I was at that party,
and it was fun, but...

909
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:45,250
it kinda felt like I was watching it
from across the room.

910
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:49,671
I don't know,
there's this invisible line

911
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,798
that I have to cross
to really be a part of everything

912
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,425
and I just,
I can't ever cross it.

913
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,721
I feel that way
sometimes, too.

914
00:43:58,347 --> 00:43:59,932
(laughs) Not tonight you didn't.

915
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,683
Yeah, I was trying something.

916
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:05,062
Yeah, sometimes I think
it'd be so much easier

917
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,648
to be one of these people who
can just take a few shots

918
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,399
and then hook up
with whoever's closest.

919
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,070
Yeah, I guess I'm just unlucky.

920
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,196
Unlucky?

921
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:16,865
Why?

922
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,202
Because I'm not
a casual person.

923
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,789
What kind of person are you?

924
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,377
(sighs)

925
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:32,214
I think I'm the kind of person
who is destined to care so much

926
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,007
about one person,
it nearly kills me.

927
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:40,389
Me too.

928
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:49,565
It's getting late.

929
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:06,415
Si?

930
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:08,375
Yeah?

931
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,501
Good night.

932
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:12,337
Good night.

933
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,319
SIMON: Dear Blue,

934
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,988
so one of my friends
likes the other,

935
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,575
and he has no idea.
I guess we all have secrets.

936
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:45,078
Anyway, I've been thinking about
why I haven't come out yet.

937
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:49,750
Maybe it's because it doesn't seem fair
that only gay people have to come out.

938
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,084
Why is straight the default?

939
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,545
I have something
I need to tell you.

940
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:56,089
Mom, there's something
I have to tell you.

941
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,257
Can we talk?

942
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:58,425
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

943
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,093
I'm straight.

944
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,011
I'm straight.

945
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,804
I'm sorry, Mom, it's true.

946
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,223
I like girls.

947
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:05,390
(coughing)

948
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:07,935
I like men.

949
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:09,102
You get that
from your daddy's side.

950
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,688
I'm in love with Nick.

951
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,692
I feel like I've been raising
a stranger.

952
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,110
Yes, absolutely, you have.

953
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,904
I'm heterosexual.

954
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:22,032
Oh, God. Help me, Jesus. Please.

955
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:23,825
SIMON: Or maybe it's because
I can't be sure

956
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,410
this whole "being gay" thing
is forever.

957
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,079
Or maybe it's that there's
not that much

958
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,623
of high school left
and part of me wants to hold on to

959
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:31,750
who I've always been
just a little longer.

960
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,211
And then, when I go to college
in Los Angeles,

961
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:36,296
I'll be gay and proud,
I promise.

962
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,881
("I wanna dance with somebody"
playing)

963
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,310
Yeah, maybe not that gay.

964
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:32,936
SIMON: I'm not sure
who I'm promising.

965
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:34,646
I'll keep ruminating.

966
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,064
Love, Jacques.

967
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:45,991
Shit!

968
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,497
TAYLOR: So, yeah,
after swimming with dolphins,

969
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,416
we fly to Saint Martin
for New Year's.

970
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,044
Anybody else,
Christmas in the Caribbean?

971
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:58,754
Staying here.

972
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:02,549
We have a classic Spier tradition
of French toast on Christmas Eve.

973
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,593
I'm going to an unheated
vacation house

974
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:05,552
in the middle of nowhere.

975
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,846
As is our bleak
family tradition.

976
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:10,849
(winces) Ow! Ow!

977
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,977
-Oh, man. Oh.
-You okay?

978
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:15,395
Oh, yeah, that's a paper cut.

979
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,272
Overdramatic.

980
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:21,151
Um, Simon, do you know
where the bandages are?

981
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,987
Yeah. They're just
in the supply closet.

982
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:25,697
Okay, do you mind showing me?

983
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:29,618
Be right back.

984
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,204
He's like a nurse, this man.

985
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:35,874
Okay, I don't actually have
a paper cut.

986
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,835
I know that, Martin.
You're a very bad actor.

987
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,586
What, you think this is funny?

988
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,549
Simon, look,
I don't wanna have to

989
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,551
leak your emails, all right?
But I will.

990
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:48,345
Look, you cannot
bring Blue into this, okay?

991
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,721
If he found out
that my emails got leaked,

992
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,473
he'd get totally freaked,
all right?

993
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,934
-He'd never talk to me again.
-Yeah, probably not, you know?

994
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,103
The Internet's a freaky place
to meet people.

995
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,521
-Yo.
-Hey!

996
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:58,564
Hey!

997
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,023
-Fun movie! Freak.
-Freaky Friday.

998
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:02,109
-That's a fun movie!
-Freaky, freak, freaky.

999
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,570
-Yeah, freaky-deaky Dutch!
-♪ She's a super freak ♪

1000
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:05,821
-BOTH: ♪ Super freak ♪
-You guys are weird.

1001
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,907
I need a Band-Aid.
Those programs are a bitch.

1002
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,579
Erm, yo. Martin was having
trouble running his lines

1003
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,332
and we were thinking we could go
to Waffle House and go over 'em.

1004
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,543
-Really?
-Yeah.

1005
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:20,460
That would be great.

1006
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,171
I'm insky.

1007
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:26,758
-Good work, Spier.
-Go to hell, Martin.

1008
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:32,806
(cell phone chimes)

1009
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,978
BLUE: Jacques,
if I were a betting man,

1010
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,355
I'd say you were drunk emailing me
during that last letter.

1011
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,441
Don't worry. I liked it.

1012
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,735
As for coming out,
I know what you mean

1013
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,069
about wanting to wait
till college.

1014
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:47,696
But our emails
have inspired me.

1015
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:50,782
I'm going to tell my family.
So thanks, Jacques.

1016
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:53,118
Love, Blue.

1017
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,716
(indistinct chatter)

1018
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:08,842
Yeah.

1019
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:12,262
MARTIN: Hey!

1020
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,098
-Madame.
-ABBY: Oh.

1021
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:18,477
(chuckles) Simon...

1022
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,563
How the thespians
rehearse, right?

1023
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:22,523
LYLE: Hey, guys.

1024
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:24,274
What can I get you?

1025
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:27,110
Lyle! You guys know Lyle?
We have Latin together.

1026
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:28,529
ABBY: I don't think so.

1027
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,072
Hi. How's it going?

1028
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,866
Actually, we had Bio together
last year?

1029
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,159
-SIMON: Oh, really?
-It's Simon, right?

1030
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:37,287
Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I don't, um...

1031
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:40,624
It's okay. It was like a big class,
and I have a good memory for faces.

1032
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,544
What can I get you guys?

1033
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:45,546
MARTIN: Well, we plan
on being here for a while.

1034
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,465
So, we're gonna start off small
and go larger.

1035
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:52,302
Probably get some bacon first,
some sausage. I'd say...

1036
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:55,973
ABBY: "You're right. I'm much
too strange and extraordinary.

1037
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,934
Much! And much too distracting!"

1038
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:00,310
Wow.

1039
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,729
And you never did any acting
at your old school?

1040
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,941
No. Can we get back to...

1041
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:07,609
And yet, you're from D.C., right?

1042
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,069
Yeah. Can you give me
my next cue, though?

1043
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,779
MARTIN: So why
did you move here?

1044
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:13,448
Because my parents got divorced

1045
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,450
and my aunt found us
an apartment in her building.

1046
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,828
-Why'd they get divorced?
-Why does it matter, Martin?

1047
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,205
Are you writing a book about girls
from a broken home in D.C.?

1048
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:22,791
So?

1049
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:29,047
I thought that my dad
was the greatest person on the planet.

1050
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:34,469
But it turns out that he's
just a sad, tired loser

1051
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,889
who hates his job,
drinks way too much beer,

1052
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,307
and cheats on his wife.

1053
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,393
To make up for all the stuff
that I just mentioned, so...

1054
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,769
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1055
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,396
Yeah.

1056
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,440
You deserve the father
that you thought you had.

1057
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:50,694
You know what, Abby?

1058
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,323
You deserve
a goddamn superhero.

1059
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,367
Okay, thank you.
Let's get back to the...

1060
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:58,619
Say it.

1061
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:01,038
What?

1062
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,040
I wanna hear you say,

1063
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,127
"I, Abby Susso,
am an incredible young woman

1064
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,589
and deserve
a goddamn superhero."

1065
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:13,509
-I'm not gonna say that, Martin.
-(laughing)

1066
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,260
Okay. Well, um...

1067
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:17,471
I won't stop until you say it.

1068
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,264
ABBY: Okay.

1069
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,100
-What are you...
-Excuse me.

1070
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:24,144
-Waffle House patrons!
-ABBY: Martin. Martin, stop.

1071
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,687
-Pardon the interruption.
-BOTH: Martin.

1072
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:28,190
I would just like to say
that Abby Susso here

1073
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,608
is an incredible young woman.

1074
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,692
Martin, please.

1075
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,903
And deserves
a goddamn superhero.

1076
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,155
-Okay, okay...
-That's right. Abby Susso!

1077
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,366
Abby Susso is an incredible
young woman!

1078
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:38,283
ABBY: I'm Abby Susso!

1079
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:41,078
Incredible young woman,
and deserves...

1080
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:42,955
-A goddamn superhero.
-A goddamn superhero.

1081
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:44,915
-A goddamn superhero!
-A goddamn superhero!

1082
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,625
A goddamn superhero!

1083
00:52:53,298 --> 00:52:54,174
Yeah.

1084
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:56,176
All right.
(claps)

1085
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:58,679
Breakthrough. Yeah.

1086
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:02,140
Okay, you can all go back
to your meals. Thank you.

1087
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,684
Please sit down. Please.

1088
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,020
-(Martin clears throat)
-(Abby sighs)

1089
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,230
Well...

1090
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:11,608
Well, let's get back to...

1091
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,319
-my entrance into your song.
-I'm gonna take five.

1092
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,279
(Abby laughs)

1093
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,322
MARTIN: "Ah, the Kit Kat Klub
proudly presents...

1094
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:18,323
I'll be right back.

1095
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,783
...a beautiful woman
coming straight from England."

1096
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:22,911
Sally Bowles, everybody."
(laughs)

1097
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:34,214
Hey.

1098
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:39,011
Were you in Bio when they did
that identifying leaves test?

1099
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,680
Yes. And Joel Winslow
ate that poison ivy.

1100
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,682
Because Doug Fogerty told him
it was pot.

1101
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:45,267
-Right. (laughs)
-SIMON: Poor Joel.

1102
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,686
I think he just wants
to be liked 'cause...

1103
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,523
you ever notice that he has
extra pens in his backpack?

1104
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:54,484
Like, you know,
he's just waiting for the day

1105
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,403
that someone comes up
to ask him for a pen?

1106
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,157
And then he can be that guy
to give 'em a pen.

1107
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:02,910
You see everything,
don't you, Simon?

1108
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,369
I don't know.

1109
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:07,164
But Simon means
"the one who hears"

1110
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:09,333
and Spier means
"the one who sees"

1111
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:11,627
so you put that all together

1112
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:14,671
and pretty sure that means
I was just destined

1113
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:15,964
to be up
in everybody's business.

1114
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,470
I've gotta get back inside
and scrub down some waffle irons.

1115
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:24,056
-Duty calls.
-Indeed.

1116
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:26,225
I'll see you in there.

1117
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,851
Yeah, I'll see ya.

1118
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:35,817
(cell phone chimes)

1119
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:44,660
Hi.

1120
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,330
BLUE: So my dad's flying in
tonight for Hanukkah.

1121
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,166
If you are thinking,
"But Hanukkah isn't for another month!"

1122
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:52,668
Well, you are correct.

1123
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:55,128
Welcome to navigating
divorced parents.

1124
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:57,422
Take holidays
where you can get them.

1125
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:00,592
And my dad's staying at the
same crappy motel as always.

1126
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,386
We'll do all our
horribly awkward traditions.

1127
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:06,223
We'll light the menorah
and I'll silently pray

1128
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:07,850
that the sprinklers
don't go off.

1129
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:09,643
That's happened twice before.

1130
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,856
Would you believe I'm
considering doubling down

1131
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,065
and turning
this whole awkward mess

1132
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:16,733
into a coming out thing?

1133
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:19,027
Do you think I'm crazy?

1134
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,655
SIMON: No, Blue,
I don't think you're crazy.

1135
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:24,032
I think you're crazy brave.

1136
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:41,216
ABBY: Honestly, Martin used to
annoy the crap out of me.

1137
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,343
But he's actually kind of
a cool person.

1138
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,556
I've been meaning to ask you
about your parents.

1139
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,976
I just didn't wanna say anything
when we were actually in the restaurant.

1140
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,853
I wasn't sure if you
wanted to talk about it.

1141
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:55,397
Yeah. No, I don't mention it
a lot

1142
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:58,108
because it kind of messes
with my image.

1143
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,277
What kind of image?

1144
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:06,325
The girl who is excited
to start a new school senior year.

1145
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:10,662
Girl whose life didn't
just end, like, three months ago,

1146
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,956
who's angry and sad
all the time.

1147
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,044
Girl who still believes in love.

1148
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,881
Come on.
You still believe in love.

1149
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:22,925
Maybe.

1150
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:24,885
Have you ever been in love?

1151
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:29,723
I think so.

1152
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:45,447
Abby.

1153
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:47,574
Yeah?

1154
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:51,954
I'm gay.

1155
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:54,790
Oh.

1156
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,086
You can't tell anyone though.

1157
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:01,505
Nobody really knows,

1158
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:03,382
and I don't really want people
to find out.

1159
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:04,842
I won't. I promise.

1160
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,134
Okay.

1161
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:12,432
You surprised?

1162
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:14,893
No.

1163
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:17,896
-So you knew?
-No.

1164
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:20,607
But you're not surprised?

1165
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,151
Do you want me
to be surprised?

1166
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:25,863
I don't know.

1167
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:28,156
Okay.

1168
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:30,200
Well, I love you.

1169
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:32,452
So...

1170
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:42,713
Love you, too.

1171
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:50,512
(sighs in relief)

1172
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,474
-(turn signal beeping)
-There's no one behind us.

1173
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:55,642
You don't have to put
your blinker on.

1174
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:56,894
-Okay, just being safe.
-Yeah.

1175
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,036
SIMON: Dear Blue, I hope
it goes okay with your dad.

1176
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:16,788
Whatever happens,
you inspired me.

1177
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:19,082
I came out
to my friend tonight.

1178
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:20,918
And I never would have
done that without you.

1179
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,128
Maybe we should ride
this bravery train

1180
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,546
and reveal our identities.

1181
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,549
I'm dying to know who you are.
Love, Jacques.

1182
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,224
(cell phone vibrating)

1183
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:40,395
BLUE: I told my dad.

1184
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,858
It was insanely awkward.
But also, kind of fine.

1185
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,528
And you got it backwards.

1186
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:49,696
It's you who inspires me.

1187
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,950
But I'm sorry,

1188
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,078
I'm just not ready for us to
know each other's identities.

1189
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,454
Love, Blue.

1190
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,042
(hums the Jaws theme)

1191
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:04,670
-Hey! What are you doing?
-(growls) I'm a fry shark!

1192
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,631
-Yeah!
-(laughs)

1193
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,592
-MARTIN: That is good.
-ABBY: You're a good fry shark.

1194
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:12,010
-MARTIN: Thank you, thank you.
-ABBY: I like that.

1195
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,804
-I didn't even know you were coming near.
-MARTIN: You know what day it is?

1196
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:15,931
-ABBY: What day is it?
-MARTIN: Must be Friday!

1197
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:16,849
BOTH: Oh!

1198
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:18,725
I guess I'm being loved,
right? Right?

1199
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:20,519
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

1200
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,437
Hey, what do you get
when you get black and Jewish?

1201
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:23,814
-What?
-Bluish.

1202
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,108
-ABBY (laughs): That's mean.
-Simon?

1203
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,652
Since when does Abby find
Martin so goddamn funny?

1204
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:30,320
Yeah, it's crazy.

1205
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,406
NICK: You know,
this is stupid.

1206
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,074
I'm just gonna tell her
that I like her.

1207
00:59:34,116 --> 00:59:36,201
And I've been thinking
the whole sexual experience thing,

1208
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:37,494
it's not that big of a deal.

1209
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:38,829
And, actually,
I've been practicing, right?

1210
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,956
I got this thing online. It's really cool.
It's called a pocket puss...

1211
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:42,082
Abby likes Martin.

1212
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,418
She told me herself.

1213
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:46,837
-(scoffs) But he's Martin.
-I know.

1214
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:51,133
-NICK: Look, I don't care. I'm gonna try.
-Hey, wait, wait.

1215
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,176
What about Leah?

1216
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,136
What about Leah?

1217
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:55,762
SIMON: Dude.

1218
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,267
-Leah's in love with you.
-No, she's not.

1219
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:03,353
Are you kidding me? I mean, come on.
The way she looks at you

1220
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,981
and how she's been all jealous
ever since Abby's been around?

1221
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:08,567
And she blushes every time
you come into the room.

1222
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:11,695
Look, you and Abby...

1223
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:13,822
it's never gonna happen.

1224
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:15,866
But you and Leah...

1225
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:18,243
I mean, you could be
incredible together.

1226
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:30,422
-LEAH: Hey.
-What's up?

1227
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:34,051
So I have something
to tell you.

1228
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,639
Nick just asked me to get dinner
before the homecoming game.

1229
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:41,058
Okay.

1230
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:44,102
No, like, Si, he was like...

1231
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,939
He came up to me and he's like,
"Do you wanna go get dinner?"

1232
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,981
All right, and I was like,

1233
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:49,525
"Sure, are Abby and Simon in?"
And he was like

1234
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,861
"I was thinking it could just be
the two of us. Like, a date."

1235
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:55,030
That's amazing.

1236
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,324
It is?

1237
01:00:58,951 --> 01:00:59,826
Yeah.

1238
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:01,954
Leah, come on.

1239
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,291
I know you're into him.

1240
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,459
(scoffs)
What?

1241
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,963
All that stuff that you were talking
about the night after Bram's party,

1242
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:13,715
about, you know,
being so into one person

1243
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:14,925
that it almost kills you.

1244
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,886
You were talking about Nick.

1245
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:21,390
Uh...

1246
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,268
So you think
I should go out with him?

1247
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:26,937
Yes. Yes.

1248
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:30,065
Okay.

1249
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:32,568
-SIMON: Yeah?
-LEAH: Yeah!

1250
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:34,319
SIMON: I promise you,
you're not gonna regret it.

1251
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,404
It's gonna be great!

1252
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:37,531
(all cheering)

1253
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:41,743
Let's pull out
your claws, Grizzlies!

1254
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:45,455
Oh!
(laughs)

1255
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:53,380
Simon, that Almont QB
is insanely hot.

1256
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,841
We can talk about stuff
like this now, you know.

1257
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:58,760
Yeah, I still don't know
if I really quite figured out how.

1258
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:02,931
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

1259
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:05,893
We gotta practice.
All right. Simon.

1260
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,227
-Yeah?
-Do you think

1261
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:12,024
that quarterback is lookin'
fine in those hot pants?

1262
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:14,651
He's lookin' pretty fine.

1263
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:19,114
No. No. No.

1264
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:22,951
Fine! Good.
Put your body into it.

1265
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:24,912
Fine! (grunts)

1266
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:26,330
That was really good.

1267
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:27,497
-That was so good.
-Thanks.

1268
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:29,666
Hey, check it out.
It's the Waffle House guy.

1269
01:02:31,752 --> 01:02:32,836
SIMON: Oh, yeah.

1270
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:34,671
Whoa.

1271
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,342
-Lyle?
-I don't know. Could be.

1272
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,135
-I don't know.
-Do you think he's...

1273
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:41,261
I don't know.

1274
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:43,597
Okay, well,
you should talk to him.

1275
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,183
I'm gonna go get a coffee.
Look, you are fine!

1276
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,601
(mouthing) You got this.

1277
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:49,353
Hi.

1278
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:53,607
Hey. If it isn't
my favorite waiter.

1279
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,652
Ah, there he is.
The guy who sees everything.

1280
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:57,945
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

1281
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:00,322
Hey, I wouldn't have taken you
for a homecoming guy.

1282
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:01,698
Oh, just here for the coffee.

1283
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,326
Of course. Yeah, it's all
about the cappuccinos

1284
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:05,744
and camaraderie for this guy.

1285
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:08,997
-(clears throat)
-(laughs)

1286
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:12,918
I'm glad you're here.

1287
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:14,962
You are?

1288
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:16,797
Yeah.

1289
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:19,299
'Cause I wanted to
ask you something.

1290
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:22,386
I was gonna ask you
the other day

1291
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:24,763
and then I was, like,
too chickenshit.

1292
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,183
What's Abby's deal?

1293
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:32,020
I know you and her
hang out a lot.

1294
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,856
Are the two of you
like a thing, or...

1295
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:35,732
No.

1296
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,277
No, uh, we're just friends.

1297
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:40,195
I could never be just friends
with someone that hot.

1298
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:42,364
Yeah!
Every day is a struggle.

1299
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:46,785
(sighs) I gotta go. I'll see ya.

1300
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:52,457
MASCOT: Hey! You!

1301
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,794
Little birdie told me
you're into bears!

1302
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:57,212
(growls)

1303
01:03:57,796 --> 01:03:58,672
(mascot laughs)

1304
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:00,507
Dude! It's me!

1305
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:01,925
(grunts)

1306
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:04,136
I'm the Creekwood bear.

1307
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:07,055
-Of course, you are.
-Thank you.

1308
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:08,640
Not a compliment.

1309
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,809
Hey, um... I figured out
my next move with Abby.

1310
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,644
Great, that's good for you,
Martin.

1311
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:15,606
I just wanted to run it by you
real quick.

1312
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:17,065
No, Martin, look.

1313
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:18,859
I've been helping you for weeks

1314
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:21,361
and I am sick and tired of helping you
mess with my friends' lives.

1315
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,697
So why don't you just do that shit
that you did at Waffle House?

1316
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:25,157
That went great.

1317
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:27,534
So you're saying
I should go for it?

1318
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:28,660
It's kind of a big gesture.

1319
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,913
Go big or go home!
Right, Martin?

1320
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,915
Go big or go home.

1321
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,417
I like that.
Thanks for the pep talk, man!

1322
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:37,377
Gotta get amped up.

1323
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:39,963
(grunts) Come on!

1324
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,256

He's just here
to check out the packages.

1333
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:05,447
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to grab your micropenis in public?

1334
01:05:05,948 --> 01:05:08,116
Could we get some hummus
for that baby carrot?

Yeah, uh, we got
soup dumplings.

1339

Yeah.

Hi, everyone.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

1353
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:11,680
Why are we interrupting
the national anthem?

1354
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:13,015
MARTIN:
But I have something to say...

1355
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,976
that's a little more important
than the national anthem.

1356
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,187
No offense, America.

1357
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:23,358
Abigail Katherine Susso...

1358
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,153
when you transferred
to Creekwood High School,

1359
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:28,697
just a short three
and a half months ago,

1360
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,242
you not only transferred
into a new school,

1361
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:35,495
you transferred your way
into a new heart

1362
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,999
belonging to me.
My heart. Right here.

1363
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,586
And whether it was being
your partner in pong,

1364
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,713
or your Waffle House warrior,

1365
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:46,965
I have cherished...

1366
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:52,513
the 135,300 minutes
that we've spent together.

1367
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,181
Oh, I'm sorry.

1368
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:59,019
135,301 minutes.

1369
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:02,314
And I know that you're
this smart, talented

1370
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:04,566
perfect creature.

1371
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:10,864
And, uh, I'm just a sweaty
schlub in a bear costume.

1372
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,367
But like old Bogie used to say,

1373
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:15,869
it's a "crazy mixed-up world."

1374
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:18,121
So, Abby,

1375
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:19,998
without further ado...

1376
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:23,377
will you go out with me?

1377
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,047
She's too hot for you, assface!

1378
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:30,259
Excuse me. Sorry.

1379
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,222
Just say yes. Say yes.

1380
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,139
ABBY: Martin...

1381
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,059
I am so sorry.

1382
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,895
I don't feel that way about you.

1383
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:44,857
You don't?

1384
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:47,651
No.

1385
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,903
But I really like
hanging out with you

1386
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:53,949
and I don't know, maybe we could
still be friends, you know?

1387
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:55,492
Yeah, uh...

1388
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:58,579
Are those doves?

1389
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:03,709
(crowd gasps)

1390
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,044
No, no, hey, hey! Suraj!

1391
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:08,338
Hey! No, no!
She said no! No, don't.

1392
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:11,258
(crowd laughing)

1393
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,473
Yo, I thought you said
she liked him.

1394
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:23,395
Not the ceremonious
dove launch I was hoping for.

1395
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:26,564
But still uplifting to free
some birds.

1396
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:27,941
Yeah.

1397
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:29,859
Okay, uh...

1398
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:32,112
Enjoy the game.

1399
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,366
Nice try, Martin!
And way to go, Martin!

1400
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:38,327
You gave it a shot! Right?

1401
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:40,287
(all cheering)

1402
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:50,714
That was terrible.

1403
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:53,926
Don't worry, people will get
over it in a few weeks.

1404
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:01,099
(glass shattering)

1405
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:04,269
(bear growls)

1406
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:16,281
MARTIN (imitating Trump):
This is Donald J. Trump.

1407
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:18,367
Martin Addison can't come
to the phone right now.

1408
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:21,245
Hey, Martin, it's Simon. Again.

1409
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:24,581
Um, look, I wanna make sure
you're doing all right.

1410
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:26,291
I know it's been tough
since, uh...

1411
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:30,212
Well, you know since when.
Um, listen. Just...

1412
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,006
Just give me a call back, okay?
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

1413
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,301
-(knocking on window)
-(yelps)

1414
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:39,179
Hey! What you doin' in there?

1415
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,221
Really?

1416
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:42,432
I need you to help me decorate.
Untangle these for me, will ya?

1417
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:44,017
This is not cool. I'll be down
in a minute, okay?

1418
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,978
-What's not cool?
-I'll be down in a minute.

1419
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,104
The fact that you're on
a ladder next to my room!

1420
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:49,439
I can still clearly see you.

1421
01:09:50,064 --> 01:09:53,861
All right, there you go.
Okay. Merry Christmas.

1422
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:55,487
(computer chimes)

1423
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:00,909
BLUE: Jacques,

1424
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:03,704
I'm drinking eggnog and packing
to go to my dad's cabin on Lake Rabun.

1425
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:06,081
I'm pretty sure there's a photo of it
on the Wikipedia page

1426
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:07,291
for "middle of nowhere."

1427
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,168
Middle of nowhere.

1428
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,754
I'm going to an unheated vacation house
in the middle of nowhere.

1429
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:15,382
Oh, shit.

1430
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:18,343
BLUE: There's barely electricity
and definitely no cell service

1431
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:21,013
so this will be my last email
for a while.

1432
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:23,473
It should be a real
rite of passage.

1433
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,350
A dad and his gay son
pretending they like

1434
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:27,477
to fish and trying to find
things to talk about.

1435
01:10:27,853 --> 01:10:29,271
It's gonna to be
an excruciating two weeks

1436
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:31,315
without you, Jacques.
Love, Blue.

1437
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,358
SIMON: Sounds like you're
gonna need some good music.

1438
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,321
So I'm sending a list of the seven best
Christmas songs of all time.

1439
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:39,198
Of course it includes
David Bowie's

1440
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:40,199
"Little Drummer Boy,"

1441
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,035
and Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles'
"Christmas Everyday,"

1442
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:44,703
but the number one song
you're gonna need,

1443
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:46,997
and trust me, I know this sounds
a little bit twee...

1444
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,166
("Someday at Christmas" playing)

1445
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:47,266
(cell phone ringing)

1446
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,062
-Si, have you seen it?
-Hey.

1447
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:53,605
Seen what?

1448
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:55,023
CreekSecrets.

1449
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,818
You need to look
at your computer right away.

1450
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:03,073
MARTIN: Dear fellow
Creekwood students,

1451
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:05,701
Simon Spier
has a secret male pen pal.

1452
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:06,952
Because he's gay.

1453
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,663
Interested parties
may contact him directly

1454
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:11,623
to discuss arrangements
for butt sex.

1455
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,792
Ladies need not apply.

1456
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,503
We should all probably be
talking about this

1457
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,589
instead of Martin Addison's
homecoming debacle

1458
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:20,799
which was actually
kind of sweet,

1459
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:22,718
and romantic,
if you think about it.

1460
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,345
Sincerely, Anonymous.

1461
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,229
LEAH: Si, have you read it?

1462
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:35,689
SIMON: I can't talk right now.

1463
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,316
-LEAH: No. Si, wait!
-I gotta go.

1464
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:39,318
Si?

1465
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:40,777
I saw it.

1466
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:44,198
I already reported it.
They're gonna take it down.

1467
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:47,034
It's too late. No, there's people
who've already seen it, so...

1468
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,619
it doesn't really matter.

1469
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:51,496
It's true.

1470
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,626
I'm... I'm gay.

1471
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:57,503
Oh...

1472
01:12:58,212 --> 01:12:59,463
So what are you gonna do?

1473
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:01,673
I don't know.

1474
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:03,258
You could deny it.

1475
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:07,387
Why the hell would I deny it, Nora?
I'm not ashamed of it.

1476
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,681
You've just never really
said anything.

1477
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:10,807
So what?

1478
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:13,602
What does that have to do with anything?
What the hell are you talking about?

1479
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:14,770
(sobbing) Sorry.

1480
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,319
SIMON: I know you're going
off the grid

1481
01:13:22,361 --> 01:13:24,571
and you won't see this until you're back,
but something's happened.

1482
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:26,823
You're gonna find out
who I am.

1483
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:28,951
And someone posted our emails.

1484
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:31,745
Please don't freak out.
Please, Blue.

1485
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:33,997
I need you to promise me
you won't disappear.

1486
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,292
(computer chiming)

1487
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:43,590
-(cell phone vibrating)
-(exhales)

1488
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,326
NORA:
Let me open my present.

1489
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:13,954
EMILY: Honey, I'm trying to
tell you you need to shave.

1490
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,665
JACK: Does that mean
you're gonna keep cooking?

1491
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:18,458
NORA: Yeah, of course. I can
make dinner tonight, too.

1492
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,376
-JACK: Awesome.
-What's this for?

1493
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:20,502
Oh!

1494
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,713
This one, Sherlock.
There you go.

1495
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,219
NORA: What is it?

1496
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:32,139
Bluetooth headphones.

1497
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:33,765
-Do you like the black?
-Oh, I love it.

1498
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,309
EMILY: Because I didn't
know if you liked...

1499
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,310
This is great.

1500
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,561
-They have other colors.
-He said he likes it.

1501
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,188
-SIMON: No, I love it.
-Okay. I have the receipt.

1502
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:40,105
He's good.

1503
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,698
Actually, I did want to talk
to you guys about something.

1504
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:51,825
What is it?

1505
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:55,287
Uh, well...

1506
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:56,288
JACK: Let me guess...

1507
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,208
you got somebody pregnant.

1508
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:01,585
No, you're pregnant.

1509
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,671
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm pregnant.
-JACK (chuckles): I knew it.

1510
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:05,797
He's got that glow about him,
baby.

1511
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:07,716
-EMILY: Honey.
-No. Uh...

1512
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:14,890
I'm gay.

1513
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:18,143
Honey.

1514
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:23,315
And I don't want you guys to
think anything different.

1515
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:26,276
-I'm still me.
-Of course you are.

1516
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,694
-Oh, Simon.
-Yeah.

1517
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,821
So you're gay?

1518
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:32,449
Which one of your
old girlfriends turned ya?

1519
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,284
Was it the one
with the big eyebrow...

1520
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:35,452
-Jack.
-NORA: Jesus Christ.

1521
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:36,912
Dad, can you ever
shut the hell up?

1522
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:37,871
I'm kidding.

1523
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:39,248
-It's not funny.
-I'm kidding, Nora.

1524
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,958
Just open up your gift. Please.

1525
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:47,673
EMILY: It's okay, honey.

1526
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:49,049
-Nora, I got you this.
-NORA: Simon.

1527
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:51,093
That's for you. No, that's for you.
That's from me.

1528
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:57,808
It's a Cuisinart.

1529
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:00,853
I love it. Thank you, Simon.

1530
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:07,651
SIMON: Dear Blue,
happy New Year.

1531
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,027
I haven't heard from you,

1532
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,363
so I'm going to assume it's
because you have no service.

1533
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,199
I came out to my entire family
on Christmas.

1534
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:15,826
It didn't go great.

1535
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:20,038
And I've been avoiding my friends
the whole break for all sorts of reasons.

1536
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:22,249
Change is exhausting.

1537
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,794
I feel like there's nowhere to hide
from all the newness of everything.

1538
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:27,629
Except here. With you.

1539
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:29,548
Please write to me.

1540
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:32,050
As soon as you get
even one bar of service.

1541
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:34,261
Breakfast burrito?

1542
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:36,013
Thanks.

1543
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:37,347
EMILY: Hey, Si.

1544
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:40,642
Come sit down.

1545
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:44,396
I'm gonna be late.

1546
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,079
(sighs)

1547
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:16,970
Hey, guys.

1548
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:18,889
Hey, Simon, we need to talk.

1549
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:22,643
So Abby and I hung out
on New Year's Eve, and...

1550
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:24,853
you see, now we're together.

1551
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:28,148
-That's awesome. That's great.
-NICK: Yeah, it is.

1552
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,943
But then we got to talking
about why it took so long.

1553
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,111
ABBY: Why did you tell Nick
that I have

1554
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,821
a boyfriend in college
named Jonathan?

1555
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,406
-Why'd you make that up?
-Look, Martin...

1556
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:39,660
he was the one who wrote
that CreekSecrets post about me.

1557
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,954
He screenshotted my emails

1558
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:44,665
and he's been using them
to blackmail me for months.

1559
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:47,084
What does that have to do
with us, Simon?

1560
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:51,255
He told me that if I didn't help him
get with Abby, he'd out me.

1561
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,092
And I...

1562
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:57,553
That's why I had to
keep you guys apart.

1563
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,221
So you made up a bunch of lies.

1564
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,724
And that's why you convinced me
to go on that date with Leah?

1565
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,018
You know, to keep me away
from Abby?

1566
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,104
So, wait. Running lines
at Waffle House

1567
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:08,939
and beer pong at Bram's,

1568
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:11,149
all of that was just to
pawn me off on Martin?

1569
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:13,527
I'm not
a piece of meat, Simon.

1570
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,446
You know how hard it was
for me to start over.

1571
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:19,867
I trusted you.

1572
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:21,618
(sighs)

1573
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:25,873
Hey, come on, Leah.
I'll take you to school.

1574
01:18:32,296 --> 01:18:35,132
Leah. Leah, please.
Listen, listen.

1575
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:36,550
I know I messed up, okay?

1576
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:37,926
But I knew you were
in love with Nick.

1577
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:39,678
-And I thought that maybe...
-Just stop it!

1578
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:42,723
You know what? You are
insanely stupid, Simon.

1579
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:45,767
I was never in love with Nick.
I was in love with you!

1580
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:48,187
(gasps)

1581
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,105
But...

1582
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,150
We're... We're us.

1583
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,526
Yeah, well...

1584
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:56,904
(sighs) Sorry.

1585
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:00,824
I've been trying to tell you.

1586
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:06,371
That night I slept over,
I was trying to tell you.

1587
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:10,876
You wanna know
the funniest part?

1588
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:14,129
It's that all these years, you
being so picky with girls,

1589
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:18,258
I thought that maybe it was
because you might like me, too.

1590
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:21,512
And then, you know, you told me
I should go out with Nick

1591
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,430
and I realized you were just
never gonna see me that way.

1592
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:27,059
I can deal with you
being gay, Si.

1593
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:29,770
But you set me up
to get my heart broken

1594
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,564
when you thought I was in love with Nick
and that just makes you cruel.

1595
01:19:38,654 --> 01:19:40,906
-(car engine starts)
-(Simon sighs)

1596
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,582
(students murmuring)

1597
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:03,387
You all right?

1598
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,596
Hanging in there.

1599
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,432
Uh, for the record,

1600
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:10,269
when I was saying that we have
a lot in common, you know,

1601
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,145
I wasn't really... That's not
what I was talking about.

1602
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:13,605
Gotcha.

1603
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:15,524
Just FYI, just for the record.

1604
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:16,817
-SIMON: Okay, great. Thanks.
-All right.

1605
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:28,745
Hey, Jackie.

1606
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:31,498
Did you date me because you think
I look like a guy?

1607
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,710
No. No, I actually
broke up with you

1608
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:36,170
because you don't look
like a guy.

1609
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,882
Oh. Oh, okay. Thanks.

1610
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:41,341
Welcome.

1611
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:44,428
What did he say?

1612
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,646
(sighs)

1613
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,565
(rap music playing on phone)

1614
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:58,025
Yeah! Hey, Creekwood!

1615
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:02,029
This one's for you, Spier.

1616
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:04,907
Hey, Ethan.

1617
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:06,742
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, yeah.

1618
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:12,831
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1619
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:14,625
You like that,
don't you, Spier?

1620
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:18,795
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, Ethan, Simon likey.

1621
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:21,757
(Aaron and Spencer moaning)

1622
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,885
You have something
you wanna say to me?

1623
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:27,846
I said do you have something
to say to me?

1624
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:29,139
(turns off music)

1625
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:30,849
-I'll take it from here.
-Hey, Ms. Albright.

1626
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:32,392
Don't "Hey, Ms. Albright" me.

1627
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:35,229
We're not friends. You're not gonna
braid my hair or paint my nails.

1628
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,647
Get your ass
off the table now!

1629
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:39,316
You sweaty, hormonal virgins.

1630
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:41,610
You know what? You're about to
be suspended for so long,

1631
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:43,445
that by the time it's over,
you're gonna be

1632
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:46,198
the fat, bald, unhappily married

1633
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,409
wildly mediocre nobodies
you're destined to become.

1634
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:50,786
You can't talk to us like that.

1635
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:52,829
Actually, I can,
'cause I just did.

1636
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:54,540
And you know why?
Because you're just those two

1637
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:56,124
assholes that did
that shitty thing

1638
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,794
in front of the whole school.
And guess what?

1639
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:02,172
Nobody feels sorry for those
assholes, especially me.

1640
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,008
Now, walk.
Mr. Worth's office now.

1641
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:05,926
Bye.

1642
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:08,136
Uh-uh. That's mine now.

1643
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,848
I'mma sell it.
Get my tubes tied.

1644
01:22:11,557 --> 01:22:13,767
(scattered laughter and chatter)

1645
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:26,488
(inaudible conversation)

1646
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:29,491
Why does Mr. Worth
have to talk to us?

1647
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:32,160
I mean, can't we just
let this shit go?

1648
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:37,124
Hey, I'm sorry, Ethan.

1649
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:42,004
None of this ever happened
when just you were out.

1650
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:45,757
You know what they say,
one gay's a snooze,

1651
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:47,342
two's a hilarious hate crime.

1652
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:54,391
You could've told me
you were gay.

1653
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:58,687
I guess I didn't think
we had very much in common.

1654
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:00,981
(scoffs)
You're telling me, Simon.

1655
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:03,734
It's not like your all-hoodie wardrobe
rocks my world.

1656
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:05,152
(Simon chuckles)

1657
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,116
I don't know.

1658
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:13,076
Maybe I was jealous.

1659
01:23:14,453 --> 01:23:15,787
You've been out
since you were 16.

1660
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,083
It always seemed
so easy for you.

1661
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,251
Easy?

1662
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:23,212
Are you kidding me?

1663
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,008
My mom still tells
my grandparents

1664
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,468
about all the girls I'm dating

1665
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,262
when we go over to their house
for dinner, every Sunday.

1666
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:35,641
She says it's 'cause
they're old and religious,

1667
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:37,643
and it's just easier that way.

1668
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:40,479
I don't know,
maybe that's true.

1669
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,316
But you should hear her voice
when she talks about the girls.

1670
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:51,782
All right, boys, come on in.

1671
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:53,742
Come on.

1672
01:23:55,285 --> 01:23:56,537
All right,
just stand right here.

1673
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:57,746
(speaks French)

1674
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:00,123
Get up.

1675
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:06,338
Okay, these gentlemen have something
that they would like to say to you.

1676
01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:08,257
-We're sorry.
-Our bad.

1677
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:10,467
That's right.
'Cause at Creekwood High,

1678
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:12,427
-what do we believe in?
-BOTH: Tolerance.

1679
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:15,055
And "tolerance" means
we respect

1680
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:16,849
Simon and Ethan's choice
to be boyfriends.

1681
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,517
-We are not boyfriends.
-Yeah. No.

1682
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:21,687
Hey, whatever you wanna call it,
it's fine with me. Seriously.

1683
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,856
We call it "two people

1684
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:25,649
that are not at all
romantically involved."

1685
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,025
Yeah, I get it.
Keepin' it casual, man.

1686
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,235
I can dig, seriously.

1687
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:32,990
Oh. Simon. Hey, can we talk?

1688
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:34,908
I don't have anything to say to you.

1689
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,536
Please, please. I just wanted to say
that I was sorry, okay?

1690
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:40,747
I didn't know or think
that people still did shit like that.

1691
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,541
And I got in a lot of shit
for Homecoming,

1692
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:44,918
and I wanted everyone to focus
on something else, you know?

1693
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,420
I just didn't think
it was gonna be a big thing.

1694
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,338
I don't care if you didn't
think that my coming out

1695
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,798
was gonna be
a big thing, Martin.

1696
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:52,426
Look, you don't get to
decide that.

1697
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:54,970
I'm supposed to be the one
that decides when

1698
01:24:55,012 --> 01:24:58,015
and where, and how and who knows
and how I get to say it.

1699
01:24:58,056 --> 01:24:59,558
That's supposed to be
my thing!

1700
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,101
And you took that away
from me.

1701
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,938
So, look, can you please just
get the fuck away from me?

1702
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,157
(sighs)

1703
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:19,620
(sighs)

1704
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:28,879
(computer chimes)

1705
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,015
BLUE: I saw the posts.
I know who you are.

1706
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:41,892
Jacques a Dit.

1707
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:44,102
That's what they call
Simon Says in France.

1708
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:45,521
Very clever.

1709
01:25:46,104 --> 01:25:48,607
I'm sorry, Simon.
I can't do this anymore.

1710
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:50,442
-SIMON: Please, Blue.
-BLUE: I'm so sorry.

1711
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:53,320
SIMON: You can't leave me alone.
Everything's falling apart.

1712
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,199
(takes deep breath)

1713
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:24,726
(sobbing)

1714
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:48,125
I mean, I haven't even talked to her.
I haven't even seen her at school.

1715
01:26:50,544 --> 01:26:52,421
Anyway, I guess
I'll see you in class, right?

1716
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:53,672
-GIRL: Yeah, totally.
-CAL: Okay.

1717
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:54,590
Later.

1718
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:57,718
-Hey.
-Hey, Simon.

1719
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:01,221
Is it you?

1720
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,516
Are you Blue?

1721
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:08,812
No. No, it's not me. Sorry.

1722
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:14,902
I know you've had a crazy couple days.
You wanna talk about it?

1723
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,487
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

1724
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:19,573
-No, don't worry.
-Sorry for bothering you.

1725
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:40,385
(door closes)

1726
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:01,698
Did you know?

1727
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:09,081
I knew you had a secret.

1728
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:16,839
I mean, when you were little,
you were so carefree.

1729
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:22,469
But these last few years,
more and more...

1730
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:26,807
it's almost like I could
feel you holding your breath.

1731
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,400
I wanted to ask you
about it, but I...

1732
01:28:37,526 --> 01:28:39,069
didn't wanna pry.

1733
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:45,742
-Maybe I made a mistake.
-No. No, Mom, you...

1734
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:48,912
You didn't make a mistake.

1735
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:55,460
EMILY: Being gay is your thing.

1736
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:59,339
There are parts of it
you have to go through alone.

1737
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,799
I hate that.

1738
01:29:02,426 --> 01:29:05,220
As soon as you came out,
you said, "Mom, I'm still me."

1739
01:29:09,141 --> 01:29:10,434
I need you to hear this.

1740
01:29:12,853 --> 01:29:15,314
You are still you, Simon.

1741
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:22,446
And you are still the same son
who I love to tease,

1742
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:26,700
and who your father depends on
for just about everything.

1743
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:29,036
And you're the same brother

1744
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,164
who always compliments
his sister on her food,

1745
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,124
even when it sucks.

1746
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,088
But you get to exhale now,
Simon.

1747
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:45,552
You get to be more you
than you have been...

1748
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,556
in a very long time.

1749
01:29:57,064 --> 01:29:58,857
You deserve
everything you want.

1750
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:14,790
My boy.

1751
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,141
Hey, Leah.

1752
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:34,726
-Hey.
-What's up?

1753
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:35,936
What are you doing?

1754
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:38,313
Just going for a run,
you know.

1755
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:41,483
-Daily ritual.
-Yeah, you've never done that.

1756
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:43,277
Have too.

1757
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:45,112
But you're wearing jeans.

1758
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:47,781
They're my running jeans.

1759
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:49,491
Simon, you're about to pass out.

1760
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,119
(panting) Okay, fine.
I'm not going for a run.

1761
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:55,122
Hey, Leah. Please, listen.

1762
01:30:55,163 --> 01:30:56,540
Look, I know, okay?

1763
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:57,916
You didn't want anyone
to know you're gay.

1764
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,459
No, that wasn't just it.

1765
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:04,298
I fell in love with someone.

1766
01:31:05,966 --> 01:31:07,259
That guy in the emails...

1767
01:31:09,261 --> 01:31:10,137
I love him.

1768
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:13,765
And I knew that if Martin
leaked our emails,

1769
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:14,808
it'd scare him off.

1770
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:16,977
I'm sorry.

1771
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:21,315
I know what I did
was messed up.

1772
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:26,111
You're my best friend.

1773
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:27,571
If I'm your best friend,

1774
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:29,198
then why did you come out
to Abby and not me?

1775
01:31:32,284 --> 01:31:33,327
Think it was easier.

1776
01:31:35,204 --> 01:31:36,747
I've known Abby for six months,

1777
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:40,292
and I've known you
for 13 years.

1778
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:44,004
And I knew that if I told you,

1779
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:45,797
that everything
was gonna be different.

1780
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:49,843
I really wanted things
to stay the same.

1781
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:56,141
Tell me about this guy
you love.

1782
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:01,897
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1783
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:04,650
It'll help me kill off
Hetero Simon in my mind.

1784
01:32:05,442 --> 01:32:07,903
-You don't have to kill him off.
-He's dead, Si.

1785
01:32:08,362 --> 01:32:10,322
Hacking him up with
a mental machete as we speak.

1786
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:12,699
(chuckles)

1787
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:14,952
All right. Fair enough.

1788
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:19,248
So, I call him Blue.

1789
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:30,759
Hey, Si.

1790
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:33,846
Yeah?

1791
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:40,435
(sighs)

1792
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:45,774
How long have you known?

1793
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,905
Like, I really started to get it
when I was around...

1794
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:55,075
thirteen?

1795
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:57,077
Four years? Four years of...

1796
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:01,456
eating dinner together, four years of
going to movies together.

1797
01:33:01,707 --> 01:33:04,418
Four years of
walking Bieber together.

1798
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,796
I'm sorry.

1799
01:33:08,881 --> 01:33:09,965
I shouldn't have missed it.

1800
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:12,134
No. Hey, no, Dad.

1801
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:13,635
All those stupid jokes...

1802
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,721
Well, I know
you didn't mean 'em.

1803
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:17,306
It doesn't matter.
I shouldn't have missed it.

1804
01:33:21,518 --> 01:33:22,394
But...

1805
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:25,147
in case the message
got lost somewhere I just...

1806
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:28,775
I just want you to know
that I love you.

1807
01:33:31,153 --> 01:33:32,446
(crying) And I'm really
proud of you.

1808
01:33:34,072 --> 01:33:36,033
I wouldn't change anything
about you.

1809
01:33:39,203 --> 01:33:40,454
Hey. Shit, Dad.

1810
01:33:43,332 --> 01:33:44,208
Hey, stop crying.

1811
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,376
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1812
01:33:47,628 --> 01:33:48,670
Oh, God.

1813
01:33:51,173 --> 01:33:52,049
Come here.

1814
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,519
How's that video
for Mom coming?

1815
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:05,395
-Good.
-Good, good.

1816
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:06,313
Good.

1817
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:11,193
-You don't know how to export it, do you?
-Can you help me with that, please?

1818
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:12,319
Yeah.

1819
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:13,695
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1820
01:34:14,446 --> 01:34:15,322
Hey.

1821
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:18,242
I thought maybe we could
sign up for Grindr together.

1822
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,036
You don't know
what Grindr is, do you?

1823
01:34:22,204 --> 01:34:23,914
It's Facebook for gay people.

1824
01:34:24,706 --> 01:34:25,707
Not what it is.

1825
01:34:29,503 --> 01:34:32,506
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you 20 years of bliss.

1826
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:37,010
(video playing)

1827
01:34:41,348 --> 01:34:42,724
EMILY: Did you guys do this?

1828
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:45,394
Simon and I did it, yeah.

1829
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,063
-I just helped.
-It was mostly me.

1830
01:34:48,397 --> 01:34:49,648
EMILY (laughs):
Yeah, right.

1831
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:55,237
Really? Really?

1832
01:34:57,197 --> 01:34:58,657
EMILY: I can't believe
you did this.

1833
01:34:59,616 --> 01:35:01,451
I panicked
and bought you a watch.

1834
01:35:02,035 --> 01:35:03,036
That's okay.

1835
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:05,622
You can give me somethin' later
that I can't get in the store.

1836
01:35:05,998 --> 01:35:07,249
That's really gross.

1837
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,376
-Oh, guys, just look.
-Sorry, just pay attention.

1838
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:11,253
Just look at baby Bieber!

1839
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,421
NORA: He was so cute!

1840
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:14,089
EMILY: Just look at our baby!

1841
01:35:18,177 --> 01:35:19,970
SIMON: Dear students
of Creekwood High School,

1842
01:35:20,637 --> 01:35:23,223
As anyone with a half-decent
data plan already knows,

1843
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:27,311
a recent post on this very website
declared that I was gay.

1844
01:35:28,228 --> 01:35:30,939
The delivery left something
to be desired, but the message is true.

1845
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:33,692
I am... gay.

1846
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:37,196
For a long time, I was killing
myself to hide that fact.

1847
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:39,489
I had all these reasons.

1848
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:41,742
It was unfair that only
gay people had to come out.

1849
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:43,243
I was sick of change.

1850
01:35:43,535 --> 01:35:44,953
But the truth is
I was just scared.

1851
01:35:44,995 --> 01:35:46,121
COACH: Come on, Garrett.
Let's go!

1852
01:35:46,163 --> 01:35:47,789
SIMON: At first I thought
it was just a gay thing.

1853
01:35:48,123 --> 01:35:50,042
But then I realized,
no matter what,

1854
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,878
announcing who you are
to the world is pretty terrifying

1855
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:55,506
because what if the world
doesn't like you?

1856
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:58,550
So, I did whatever I could
to keep my secret.

1857
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:01,887
I hurt the best,
most important people.

1858
01:36:01,929 --> 01:36:03,597
And I want them to know
that I'm sorry.

1859
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:05,724
I am done being scared.

1860
01:36:06,475 --> 01:36:09,353
I'm done living in a world
where I don't get to be who I am.

1861
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:11,563
I deserve a great love story.

1862
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:14,233
Disclaimer, this is about
to get romantic as eff,

1863
01:36:14,608 --> 01:36:16,693
so anyone adverse to
gratuitous feelings

1864
01:36:16,735 --> 01:36:18,654
kindly click over to the BuzzFeed quiz

1865
01:36:18,695 --> 01:36:20,906
or resume the porn
you paused to read this.

1866
01:36:21,281 --> 01:36:23,867
-Did you even use the ladder?
-SIMON: This guy that I love once wrote

1867
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:26,036
that he felt like he was stuck
on a Ferris wheel.

1868
01:36:26,745 --> 01:36:27,996
On top of the world
one minute,

1869
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:29,623
at rock bottom the next.

1870
01:36:30,457 --> 01:36:31,500
That's how I feel now.

1871
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:35,295
I couldn't ask
for more amazing friends,

1872
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:37,256
a more understanding family.

1873
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:40,634
But it would all be so much better
if I had someone to share it with.

1874
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:44,513
So, Blue...

1875
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,641
I might not know your name
or what you look like.

1876
01:36:49,184 --> 01:36:50,227
But I know who you are.

1877
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:53,230
I know you're funny
and thoughtful.

1878
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:56,775
That you choose your words carefully
and that they're always perfect.

1879
01:36:57,734 --> 01:37:00,237
And I know that you've been
pretending for so long

1880
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:01,738
it's hard to believe
you can stop.

1881
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:03,365
I get it.

1882
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:06,076
Like I told you
at the very beginning,

1883
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:07,661
I'm just like you.

1884
01:37:07,703 --> 01:37:09,580
-GIRLS: Hi, Simon.
-SIMON: What's up?

1885
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:10,747
SIMON: So, Blue...

1886
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:14,585
after the play, Friday at 10:00,
you know where I'll be.

1887
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:18,088
No pressure for you to
show up, but I hope you do.

1888
01:37:19,047 --> 01:37:20,924
Because you deserve
a great love story too.

1889
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,927
Love, Simon.

I'm not even kidding.

1902
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:24,071
-You were, like, insane.
-Thank you!

1903
01:38:24,112 --> 01:38:25,739
-What's up?
-Baby!

(clears throat)

1907
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:38,585
-Hey, Simon.
-Hey.

1908
01:38:41,922 --> 01:38:43,799
Do you wanna go to
the carnival with us tonight?

1909
01:38:49,096 --> 01:38:49,972
Yes.

1910
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:51,348
-Yeah?
-SIMON: Yeah!

1911
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:52,432
LEAH: Yay!

1912
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:53,642
Get in here, Leah!

1913
01:38:54,184 --> 01:38:55,269
LEAH (grunts): The love!

1914
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:56,728
Thank you.

1915
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:17,291
-We'll be right here.
-Yeah.

1916
01:39:17,332 --> 01:39:18,917
-Go get him.
-All right.

1917
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:20,502
-Yes!
-Woo! Yeah!

1918
01:39:20,544 --> 01:39:21,503
Go, Simon!

1919
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:23,255
-Spier, Spier, Spier!
-Woo!

1920
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:25,549
That should last a while.

1921
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:30,512
GIRL: Oh, my God, look.

1922
01:39:30,554 --> 01:39:32,389
I bet he's waiting
for the other gay kid.

1923
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:33,974
Where's Dana?
She'll love this.

1924
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:38,103
ABBY: You got this, buddy.
Proud of you.

1925
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:39,396
(students cheering)

1926
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:41,315
-Yeah, buddy!
-Yeah!

1927
01:39:41,356 --> 01:39:42,441
You got it! Woo!

1928
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,567
ABBY: This is it.

1929
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,156
ALL: Yeah!

(all cheering)

1933
01:40:02,294 --> 01:40:04,171
Yo. Can you just...
Come on, no.

1934
01:40:09,676 --> 01:40:11,094
(all whooping)

1935
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,444
MAN: Go, Simon!

1936
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:35,327
Okay. That's your
last ride ticket, buddy.

1937
01:40:37,579 --> 01:40:38,789
MARTIN: Wait. Wait!

1938
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,586
Simon, it's me.

1939
01:40:46,505 --> 01:40:48,590
I'm Blue. l love you.

1940
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:52,928
-No, you're not.
-No, I'm not. I just...

1941
01:40:54,012 --> 01:40:56,139
This is so brutal.

1942
01:40:58,058 --> 01:40:59,601
Here. I'll tell you what.

1943
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,688
I got a couple...
How much is it?

1944
01:41:03,397 --> 01:41:06,316
-It's four tickets, four bucks.
-Perfect. Okay. There you go.

1945
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:07,234
Last one's on me.

1946
01:41:08,944 --> 01:41:09,820
Got it.

1947
01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:13,699
Last call for the Ferris wheel!

1948
01:41:16,285 --> 01:41:18,620
Oh, no, I can't watch.
I can't watch this, babe. No.

1949
01:41:19,288 --> 01:41:20,372
This is awful.

1950
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:22,499
-Okay, Dora.
-Wait, wait.

1951
01:41:24,418 --> 01:41:25,419
Can I sit there?

1952
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:27,880
I was kind of waiting
for somebody.

1953
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:30,299
Yeah, I know.

1954
01:41:35,387 --> 01:41:36,430
It's Bram!

1955
01:41:42,728 --> 01:41:43,604
It's you.

1956
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:46,315
It's me.

1957
01:41:49,735 --> 01:41:51,195
But that night at the party...

1958
01:41:51,445 --> 01:41:54,323
Yeah.
I was drunk and confused.

1959
01:41:54,364 --> 01:41:56,825
And it ended, like,
a minute after you saw us.

1960
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:01,246
And you're Jewish.

1961
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:03,040
Yeah.

1962
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:05,167
Which is cool.

1963
01:42:05,209 --> 01:42:06,168
(laughs)

1964
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:07,377
And I'm black too.

1965
01:42:08,837 --> 01:42:09,713
And gay.

1966
01:42:11,215 --> 01:42:12,216
It's kind of crazy, huh?

1967
01:42:12,508 --> 01:42:13,467
I didn't think you'd come.

1968
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:15,677
Me neither.

1969
01:42:16,094 --> 01:42:19,306
Until I was walking towards you,
I didn't think I had it in me.

1970
01:42:27,814 --> 01:42:29,566
(all murmuring)

1971
01:42:40,369 --> 01:42:41,870
Are you disappointed
that it's me?

1972
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:46,667
No.

1973
01:42:50,379 --> 01:42:53,674
(all cheering)

1974
01:43:27,332 --> 01:43:28,959
(cell phone ringing)

1975
01:43:33,297 --> 01:43:34,214
Hey.

1976
01:43:34,256 --> 01:43:35,424
LEAH: Have you seen
CreekSecrets?

1977
01:43:35,465 --> 01:43:37,885
There are six new confessions,
all signed.

1978
01:43:38,552 --> 01:43:39,428
Listen to this.

1979
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:42,472
"My parents didn't come
and see me in Cabaret.

1980
01:43:42,723 --> 01:43:44,474
They hate that I wanna be
an actor.

1981
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,894
I don't know if they'll ever
be proud of me.

1982
01:43:47,269 --> 01:43:48,353
Taylor Metternich."

1983
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:49,646
Wow.

1984
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:51,648
You're a trendsetter, Spier.

1985
01:43:52,691 --> 01:43:54,526
Now, come on, get in the car.
We need to go.

1986
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,747
-Good morning!
-Ah, there he is!

1987
01:44:06,788 --> 01:44:08,415
-Morning, Simon.
-Top of the morning, kid.

1988
01:44:08,707 --> 01:44:09,583
What's this?

1989
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:11,919
-Nora's specialty.
-Mm, coconut?

1990
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,253
-Yeah.
-You look good.

1991
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:15,172
-Have a good day, honey.
-You too.

1992
01:44:15,214 --> 01:44:16,632
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

1993
01:44:16,924 --> 01:44:18,675
-I'll see you guys.
-What, you're not gonna eat?

1994
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:19,635
Bye, Simon.

1995
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:23,305
("Wild Heart" playing)

1996
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:34,066
-Mornin'.
-Hey, buddy.

1997
01:44:43,075 --> 01:44:44,952
-Good morning.
-Hey! How you doin', Leah?

1998
01:44:44,993 --> 01:44:46,328
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1999
01:44:57,923 --> 01:44:58,841
Hey!

2000
01:45:06,306 --> 01:45:07,182
Hey.

2001
01:45:11,728 --> 01:45:12,980
-Morning.
-Morning.

2002
01:45:16,733 --> 01:45:17,651
Everybody in?

2003
01:45:17,693 --> 01:45:18,610
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah.

2004
01:45:18,652 --> 01:45:19,653
All right, it's too beautiful
a day,

2005
01:45:19,695 --> 01:45:21,780
so I think I'm gonna actually
take us on a little adventure.

2006
01:45:22,406 --> 01:45:23,615
-Yes!
-Woo!

2007
01:45:23,657 --> 01:45:25,951
-That's exactly what I need!
-NICK: Yeah, adventure!

2008
01:47:48,927 --> 01:47:55,893
(instrumental music playing)
