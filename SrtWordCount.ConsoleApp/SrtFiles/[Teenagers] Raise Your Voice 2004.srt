00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:58,100
Jeremiah was a bullfrog...
Bullfrog

2
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,833
Was a good friend of mine

3
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,533
Was a good friend of mine

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,267
Never understood
a single word he said

5
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,733
But I helped him drink his wine
Oh my, my

6
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,767
Yes, he always had
some mighty fine wine

7
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:10,933
So fine

8
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:14,400
Singing joy to the world
Joy to the world

00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:17,700
All the boys and girls
All the boys and girls

10
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:20,967
Joy to the fishes
in the deep blue sea

11
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:24,000
Joy to you and me

12
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:27,600
If I were the king of the world
King of the world

13
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,733
I tell you what I'd do
I tell you what I'd do

14
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:34,033
I'd throw away the cars
and the bars and the wars

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,167
And make sweet love to you
Sweet love

16
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:40,300
Singing joy to the world
Joy to the world

Joy to you and me...

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,033
Key chanre!

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,933
Joy to you and me
You and me

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,867
Joy to the world
Joy to the world

00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,200
All the boys and girls
All the boys and girls

27
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,633
Joy to the fishes
in the deep blue sea

28
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,700
Joy to you and me...

29
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,567
Big ending!

30
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:22,633
Joy to you and me!

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,633
Have a very pleasant
summer everyone.

32
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,733
Ms. Fletcher, rehearsal tomorrow
at 4:00.

33
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,467
Oh, and I did send in that
recommendation you requested.

34
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,300
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Holcombe. Bye.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,467
Are you actually
going tomorrow?

36
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,500
Call me a dork,
but I love choir practice.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,067
And I don't want
to let him down.

38
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,100
All right, last day!

39
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,800
Hey, Terri, hey, Terri.
Hey, Matthew.

40
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,833
Hey.

41
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,133
I, uh, I got the concert tickets
that you wanted.

42
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,700
Oh, um,
I've got the money.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,733
Awesome.
There you go.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,033
So, um,

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,067
I'll see you
at rehearsal then.

46
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,600
Okay, cool.
See you then.

47
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,500
Okay.

48
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,033
Oh my God!

49
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,067
He's going to spend
the whole next month

50
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,067
hoping he didn't just
get you prernant.

51
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,467
Oh, shut up.
He's so nice.

52
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,000
Play it loud

53
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,400
Play it loud

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,200
Raise your voice

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,767
Shout it out

56
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,933
We weren't the first

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,467
But we're
holding our own...

58
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:38,167
As hordes of
summer-starved teenagers

59
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:41,433
descend on unsuspecting
Flagstaff, Arizona,

60
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,967
let's see what these two
poised younr women

61
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,067
have to say about
the last day of school!

62
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,933
I'm outta here, Riverdale!
Yeah, school's out, baby!

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All right.
The camera loves you.

64
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,133
So, Lauren, what are
you doing tonight?

65
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,800
Paul, stop hitting
on my friend.

66
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,767
Whatever you're
doing tonight.

67
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,800
Lauren, stop hitting
on my brother. Urh!

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,367
Hey, would you tell Mom
I'll be late?

69
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,167
But it's your graduation
barbecue.

70
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,733
I've got places to go, people to see.
Just save me a burnt burrer.

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,767
Will you give me a ride home?
Sure.

72
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,067
Play it loud

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,267
Play it loud

74
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:19,933
Raise your voice

75
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:23,567
Shout it out

76
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:26,100
Play it loud

77
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,600
Play it loud

78
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,967
Raise your voice

79
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:37,733
Shout it out

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Play it loud

81
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,200
Play it loud...

82
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,200
Thanks, Lauren.
Anytime.

83
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,933
Hey, I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, have fun tonight.

84
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:51,067
Play it loud.

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
So, Terri Boo-berry,
what are you up to this summer?

86
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,967
I'm singing in choir.
Cool.

87
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,733
Yeah, and, um, I'm working
at the restaurant again.

88
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,700
Wow, what fun.
Yeah.

89
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,200
But mostly, I really want to get into
this music summer prorram in August.

90
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,600
Really, which one?
Some music thing in L.A.

91
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,667
Dad! Come on! It's not
just some music thing in L.A.

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
It's Bristol-Hillman
Music Conservatory.

93
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,133
Only the best summer music
prorram on the West Coast,

94
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,633
maybe even in the whole country.
Terri, don't start.

95
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:26,067
But Dad, this is
so important to me.

96
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,500
Plus, I already sent
in my application and I sent a CD

97
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,467
because Mom said I could.
That's it! You're not going!

98
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:36,000
Simon, don't be so closed-minded.
Nina, please.

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,667
Terri...

100
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,400
Where've you been?
Hanging out with some of the ruys.

101
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:48,100
Saying goodbye, that stuff.
Hey, Aunt Nina!

102
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,467
Happy graduation.
Thanks.

103
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,367
Here.
Oh here, I'll take it in.

104
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,400
Hey, what's wrong?

105
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,400
Terri just wants to go
to this great music prorram in L.A.

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,667
and your Dad's being his usual
squash-any-good-idea self.

107
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:06,133
Nina, the prettiest girls
from all the hirh schools go to L.A.

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,000
You know what happens
to most of them?

109
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,067
Dad, you don't think Terri's special?
Paul, seriously.

110
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,767
I think she's the most special
human being on the planet.

111
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,800
She's my girl.

112
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,433
That's why she's
not going to L.A.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,033
She's 16, for God's sakes.
What's wrong with you people?

114
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,967
Hundreds of people
apply for this.

115
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:26,200
If she rets in, it's proof she belongs
there, but you get that, right?

116
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,733
Look, when I was your are,
I thought I knew everything too.

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,133
But I've seen a lot more of the world
than you have, Paul.

118
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
What parts of the world
have you seen, Dad?

119
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:35,733
The back and front
of your dad's restaurant?

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,500
Okay, okay.
Paul, that's enourh.

121
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,133
Well, just because you're stuck
here, you want everyone stuck with you.

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,200
You better watch your mouth
or you're gonna get rrounded.

123
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,333
All right, listen.
Can we please stop fighting?

124
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:50,100
It's a graduation party.
We're suppose to be celebrating here.

125
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,100
All right?

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
I can't get
these damn coals to light.

127
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,067
Oh, well here, try this.
What are you doing?

128
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,733
God. Stop. That's it!
You're rrounded! Get in the house.

129
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,600
I just love our family get-torethers.
Uh, I'll be back.

130
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,000
Always have.

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,267
So...

132
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,800
I never got a chance to tell you
congratulations on Arizona State.

133
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:31,667
Thanks.
At least I'm getting outta here.

134
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:35,567
Aunt Nina, if Terri rets
into that music prorram,

135
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,467
you gotta make sure
she goes.

136
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,633
She'll suffocate staying here.
Yeah, I know.

137
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,767
I was thinking
the same thing.

138
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,300
So you're on my side?

139
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,333
Always.

140
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,133
Hey.

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,667
What's going on?

142
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,333
Nothing.
Nothing.

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, right.

144
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,300
There's a light in me

145
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,467
And it's shining bright

146
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:14,767
I can almost
touch the sky...

147
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,500
The sky.

148
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:21,633
You're the reason
I believe...

149
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,533
Hello, annoying.

150
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,333
Hey! Easy on the hardware.

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,500
What are you doing?
Filming America's most boring teenagers?

152
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,867
And I feel so strong...

153
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,633
Ladies and gentlemen,

154
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,567
tonight on "The Fletcher Experience,"
we have a special treat.

155
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,667
It's my sincere pleasure to present
to you the distinctive vocal stylings

156
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,900
of the one, the only,
Terri Fletcher!

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,467
Oh, well, Paul, that is
so very kind of you. Thank you.

158
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:01,033
This next song
I wrote for my fans.

159
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,667
Something's got
ahold of me

160
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,967
But I will follow
where you go

161
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:12,333
One more mile to Jericho

162
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,367
The walls will tumble

163
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,367
The walls will tumble--

164
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,600
The music fills the space

165
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,333
And it takes the pain away

166
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,633
And I know
it's gonna be all right.

167
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,700
When you're sad and lonely

168
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,567
Tell Him what you want

169
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:39,233
Hold Him up and tell Him
what you want.

170
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,433
'Cause I just can't wait
till you write me

171
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,767
You're coming around
Around

172
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,933
Now I'm walking
on sunshine, whoa-oh

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,100
And don't it feel good, hey!
Oh, yeah, now

174
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,367
And don't it feel good...

175
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,667
Oh--

176
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Hey, what are you
doing here?

177
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,400
Um, uh...

178
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:31,133
With all the stuff
that went on this afternoon

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,633
I almost forrot to give you
your graduation present.

180
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,300
Three Days Grace?
Yes.

181
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,700
Oh my God! When?

182
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,000
It's tonight.

183
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:45,300
Oh, no.

184
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,300
Didn't you hear
I was rrounded?

185
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:51,200
Paul. Come on.
It's not like you never break the rules.

186
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,767
If you don't go,
I can't go either.

187
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,567
Please.
It's Three Days Grace.

188
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:00,600
Side window? Should we go?
Side window.

189
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,267
All right.

190
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,400
Quiet, quiet!

191
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,533
I can't believe
you sprunr me.

192
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,167
This is a first.

193
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,900
Well, who know when we'll ever
break the law again, right?

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,067
I'm not, uh, staying
in Flagstaff Terri.

195
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,967
I lined up a job in Phoenix

196
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,933
and I'm going straight to Arizona State.
I'm not coming back.

197
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,100
Just like that?
I mean...

198
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,733
It's time.

199
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,633
Dad and l...

200
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,467
need...

201
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,900
It's just time.

202
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,967
The only thing I feel bad
about is leaving you here.

203
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:52,267
No. You don't have to worry about me.
We get along okay.

204
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,867
Yeah, that's what
worries me.

205
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:57,567
It's more than getting along, Terri.
You please them.

206
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,567
You're like a Stepford daughter out
of a mail-order marazine.

207
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,067
Is that a form of flattery?

208
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,933
After Dad slammed you
on Bristol-Hillman,

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,367
you're going to tell me
that didn't hurt?

210
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:11,733
No, it totally hurt.
Then make a scene!

211
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,033
Break something! Scream!
I... something.

212
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,400
Huh-huh. Tantrums were
never my thing.

213
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,833
Terri, you've got the best
voice I've ever heard,

214
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,733
but if you hanr with the "World
According to Simon Fletcher" any longer,

215
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,767
you're going to be doing
"Cats" at the Y at 40.

216
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,600
And that would suck.

217
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,367
That would suck.

218
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,433
Home!

219
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:38,133
This house
is not a home...

220
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:43,133
Oh my God!
This house is not a home.

221
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,400
What's up, Flagstaff?
How you ruys doing, all right?

222
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,267
Yeah.

223
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:18,333
You said
we'd never get this far

224
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,867
You said your words
Words

225
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,133
We played our parts

226
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:27,200
Said your two cents
now it's my turn

227
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,100
So sit down, shut up,
are you ready?

228
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:36,033
So you think you know

229
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,867
How this story goes...
Little help?

230
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,433
Are you ready for this?
Paul, don't-oh my God.

231
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,367
Sit down!

232
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,033
Are you ready for this?

233
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,567
Shut up!

234
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,733
Are you ready for this?

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,000
Stand up!

236
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,367
Are you ready for this?

237
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,300
This rame

238
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,367
Are you ready?

239
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,367
Are you ready?

240
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,700
Are you ready for this?

241
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,700
Sit down

242
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,067
Are you ready for this?

243
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,100
Shut up

244
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,633
Are you ready for this?

245
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,367
Stand straight!

246
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,767
Are you ready?

247
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,667
Paul, Look out!

248
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,567
Are you ready for this?

249
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:16,933
Oh! Thank God.

250
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,467
Paul?

251
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,933
No.

252
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,700
Healing nicely.

253
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,733
Still got that headache?

254
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,900
Can you tell me
your birthday?

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,933
April 20th.

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,133
Let's let Terri
get the next one.

257
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,167
Tell me what month it is.

258
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,867
June.
What's wrong with her?

259
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,000
Why can't she speak?

260
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:05,167
Terri, tell me what month
it is out loud.

261
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,667
It's June.

262
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,700
That's good.

263
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,733
Now follow this light
with your eyes.

264
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,467
Doc, stop!
Whatever you're doing, just stop.

265
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,000
I wish I was older.

266
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,133
I'm so afraid I'll say something stupid
and make it worse.

267
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,567
Hey, Aunt Nina.

268
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,600
Hi, Terri Boo-berry.

269
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,367
Honey.

270
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:04,000
Why was this in the trash?
You got in.

271
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,633
Congratulations.

272
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,633
Paul would be so proud of you.
Mom, what are you doing?

273
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,633
If Paul were here,
he would just get

274
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,867
in another screaming fight
with Dad about it.

275
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,967
Okay. Everything
is different now.

276
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,567
Do you still want to go?
I don't want to sing anymore.

277
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:23,033
I don't believe that,
Terri.

278
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,533
Why don't you let me
handle your Dad about this.

279
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:34,533
I think Terri should come visit me.
Hmm.

280
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,933
Simon, I really think
she needs to get away

281
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and I'd like her to come to Palm Desert
for the month of August.

282
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,867
A month with you, alone in the desert?
Are you nuts?

283
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,967
It is alone, isn't it?

284
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:50,167
I'm between ruys right now.
So yes, I'm alone.

285
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,667
Yeah, for the moment.

286
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,900
Well who's going to help me
in the restaurant?

287
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, is that really what
you want to say, Simon?

288
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,667
"Who's gonna help me
with the restaurant?"

289
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,667
Aunt Nina, who said that
you could do that?

290
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,867
I've never lied
to my father before.

291
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,267
Terri, I just think
this is your life.

292
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,267
You deserve
the chance to live it.

293
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,200
Then why
does it feel so wrong?

294
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,733
There's something
about your dad

295
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,533
that I don't think
you know.

296
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,833
He and his friend David both got
football scholarships to UCLA.

297
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,067
Really?

298
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,233
And when graduation
rolled around,

299
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,567
our family restaurant
was doing good,

300
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,967
but our parents weren't.

301
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,567
Neither of us
wanted the restaurant,

302
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,767
but your Dad felt he had
no choice but to take it.

303
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,600
And, uh, his friend David
went on to UCLA.

304
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,133
And he got caught up
in the L.A. scene

305
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,767
and he's been messed up
ever since.

306
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,800
But I know

307
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,167
that if your Dad had taken
that scholarship,

308
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,500
he would have made it.

309
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,567
So, what does that
have to do with me?

310
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,767
I don't know.
Everything?

311
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,967
But it's
your decision, Terri.

312
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,700
He would have wanted
you to have this, honey.

313
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,433
Paul would have wanted
you to have this.

314
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,200
I shouldn't
have snuck him out.

315
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:21,733
Oh, honey,
it's not your fault,

316
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,233
it's not your fault.
I feel so bad all the time.

317
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,267
No.

318
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:33,400
I can't do this.

319
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,933
I can't go.
I can't lie to Dad.

320
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,267
It's just too soon.

321
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,267
Honey...

322
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,833
I will tell Dad that you're
really not at Nina's

323
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,867
when the time
is right.

324
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,667
And he's gonna be
mad at first.

325
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:51,800
But he's gonna realize
it was the right thing to do.

326
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:55,400
You sure it's the right thing to do?
No.

327
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:58,700
I'm not sure
of anything.

328
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,100
I just want
you to be happy.

329
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,233
Okay.

330
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,867
I'll do it.

331
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,500
Okay.

332
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,933
Are you ruys
gonna be okay?

333
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:35,267
Yeah.
Yeah. We'll be fine.

334
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,300
Uh, I'm taking her
to the train station.

335
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,533
And, uh, Nina will pick her up
on the other end.

336
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,567
We'Il be fine.
Here you go. This is for you.

337
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,900
Dad.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,967
I don't want Nina to pay
for everything, and uh...

339
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,300
You wanna come home early,
you call us, okay?

340
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:55,767
Okay. I love you.

341
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,633
Me too.

342
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,633
Call me, okay?
Okay.

343
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,733
I want you
to take this.

344
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,767
You just call us
whenever you want.

345
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,033
And make sure you conference
Aunt Nina in when you do,

346
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,000
'cause you know your father,
he's gonna want to talk to her

347
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,500
every once in a while. Okay?
Got it, Mom.

348
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,767
I love you.
I love you.

349
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:50,267
Lift off, here I am,
here I go

350
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,300
Stand back,
I'm in control

351
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,967
I'm outta this world,
about to take off

352
00:23:57,067 --> 00:24:01,300
And when I reach the stars,
I still won't stop

353
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:04,800
'Cause I'm about to rocket....
Hey!

354
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:08,967
Now it's five, four,
three, two, one, lift-off

355
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,433
Lift-off

356
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:18,000
Lift-off...
Ow.

357
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,167
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
Thank you.

358
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,200
Sure.

359
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,800
Where did
my jacket go?

360
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:35,867
Welcome to L.A., baby.
Hop in.

361
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,400
It's rone.

362
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,800
Lift off,
hey you

363
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:42,000
Get used to my face

364
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:45,300
I'll be taking
over this place

365
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
'Cause the ride has been

366
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,933
A little off track

367
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:52,967
From now on
I'm on the straightest path

368
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,233
Got that look in my eye

369
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,533
Got my head in the sky,
bye-bye

370
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,533
I'm outta this world

371
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,567
About to take off

372
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:07,000
And when I reach the stars,
I still won't stop

373
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,100
'Cause I'm about to rocket
all the way to the top

374
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:15,833
Now it's five, four,
three, two, one

375
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,300
Lift off.

376
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,867
Oh, come on.

377
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,400
Hello?

378
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:39,900
Hey! Is anyone there?

379
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,500
Oh-hh--
you've got to be kidding me.

380
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,167
Hello!

381
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,867
Sorry, full up.

382
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,100
Hey!

383
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,633
Look. Are you going to make
a habit out of this?

384
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,667
Okay. It's late
and I'm tired

385
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,767
and all I want to do
is get up to my dorm. Okay?

386
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,467
What's the password?

387
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:14,900
Okay. I think we started off
on the wrong foot.

388
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm Terri.
Jay.

389
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,700
It's "monkeys"
by the way.

390
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,700
The password.
Mm-hm.

391
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:33,833
What room?
Um...

392
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,233
315.

393
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,233
Jay.
There you are.

394
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,567
Send you out for a snack
and you bring home a stray. Shame.

395
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,933
Mmm.
Hey. I'm Terri.

396
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:47,033
Uh-huh.
I'll catch you later.

397
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,100
Bye.

398
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,300
You know what?
I think I've got it from here. Thanks.

399
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,467
See ya.
Whew.

400
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,467
What?
What was that about? What did I say?

401
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm seriously...
315.

402
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,800
Oh.

403
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,800
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

404
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,500
Hey. I'm Terri,
your new roommate.

405
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,533
Great. And I thought
I had this place to myself.

406
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,267
Now turn out the damn light!
Sorry.

407
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh my rosh.

408
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:03,600
Okay. Okay.

409
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,533
Terri?
Hey. It's me.

410
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,967
Oh, thank God, Terri.
Your dad's called twice already.

411
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,967
Well, the train was late

412
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,167
and my jacket got stolen
and the cab driver was a total jerk.

413
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,767
Are you okay?

414
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,767
I'm fine. Let's just conference
Dad in, okay?

415
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,167
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

416
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:32,167
Okay.

417
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,100
Here we go.

418
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,133
Hey. Are you there?

419
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,767
Yeah.
I'm still here.

420
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:40,300
Theresa, is that you?
Hey, yeah, Dad. It's me.

421
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,133
Is Mom there too?
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:43,567
She's just
getting on the exchanre--

423
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,367
Hey, honey!
What took you so long?

424
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,900
We've been waiting
for you to call for like four hours.

425
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,067
We're sorry, Simon.
Her train was late.

426
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,067
Oh. Well.

427
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:55,367
What are you two ladies going
to do on your first big night?

428
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,933
We're watching television.
We're just eating dinner.

429
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,067
What?
eating dinner.

430
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,533
We're watching television.
Which is it?

431
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,367
We're eating dinner
while we're watching television.

432
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:06,667
right.

433
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:08,400
I thought you didn't have
a television, Nina.

434
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,767
I thought that was against
your artistic sensibilities.

435
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,767
Oh, well, I-I-I finally
gave in. Sue me.

436
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:17,600
Uh-uh, it's okay as long as you're safe.
Are you safe, honey?

437
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,367
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm just totally wiped out.

438
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:22,367
Now you get some rest.
Call us tomorrow.

439
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,167
And Nina?
Yes?

440
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:25,967
Don't corrupt my baby.

441
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,667
She's too much
like you already.

442
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,433
Don't worry, Simon.
I'll have her tattooed, with blue hair,

443
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,133
and married to a rapper in no time.
nighty-night.

444
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:35,933
Good night, Nina.
Night, Theresa.

445
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,267
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad. I love you.

446
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,300
Bye-bye.
I love you.

447
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:47,333
I think that worked.
I think I did it.

448
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Well, Paul,

449
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,933
I'm here.

450
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:03,733
I hope you're happy.

451
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,733
Hi.

452
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,333
I'm Terri, your roommate.
Yeah. Denise.

453
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,667
Okay, everyone.
Take a seat.

454
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,100
Let's be seated.

455
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,033
In case you bought
that old saw

456
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,967
that those who can't do, teach.

457
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:49,500
These talented musicians
beside me are your teachers.

458
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,567
But I'd prefer you
to think of them as your ruides.

459
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,833
Hello, and welcome to Bristol-Hillman's
summer music prorram.

460
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,500
I'd like to start
by reminding you

461
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,500
of the larre number
of talented students who applied

462
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,333
but did not get in.

463
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:03,700
Now,

464
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:07,600
this summer is not just about
learning your craft.

465
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:08,767
It's about

466
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,533
testing your limits.

467
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,367
Experimenting.
New experiences. It's about

468
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,967
building up and rocking
the foundation of that

469
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,233
which will give you
your own individual voice.

470
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,967
Now, some basics.

471
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:24,200
We have a strict 10:00 curfew,
1 1 :00 on the weekends.

472
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:29,100
Possession of banned substances
will mean immediate dismissal.

473
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,433
Hmm.
This is L.A., people.

474
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,867
Use some common sense.
Travel in pairs.

475
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,500
Lastly, the scholarship.

476
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,033
Three weeks from now,
on the last day of the prorram,

477
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,967
we will have
final performances

478
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,767
where you show us
what you've got.

479
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,633
Now a lucky student will win a $10,000
academic scholarship

480
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,800
for music study.
That's pretty good, huh?

481
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,633
So, work hard.

482
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,200
Have fun.

483
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,567
Get lost.

484
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,800
Later.

485
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,567
Okay.

486
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:05,233
I gave her three chances.
The chances have come and rone.

487
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,833
Send her back
where she came from.

488
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,900
I don't care!

489
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,233
People, rrab a seat.
My name is Mr. Torvald.

490
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,333
You are my class
and we have three weeks

491
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,200
to learn an incredibly
complex choral piece.

492
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,100
It ain't ever gonna happen,

493
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,867
but let's give it the ol'
collere try, shall we?

494
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,500
There are five solos
in the ensemble.

495
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,100
Only five people will perform solos
in front of this class.

496
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,667
And I will hand them out
in two weeks

497
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:35,100
based on participation,
exercises

498
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,367
and je nai sais quoi.

499
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,500
If you're not French,
that means,

500
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,533
"Ooh!"

501
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,667
I will also split you up
into rroups of four.

502
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,700
Yes, I still count
on my fingers.

503
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:47,167
One for each part
in the obnoxiously difficult

504
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,800
contrapuntal harmony
at the end of the book.

505
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:51,800
This piece is gonna
drive you nuts.

506
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:55,000
But when you nail it,
it feels good.

507
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,567
You.

508
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:57,667
You. You.

509
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,733
You. Group one!

510
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,233
Hey, Jay!
Nice hook.

511
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,233
Jump in and pick it up.

512
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,067
Ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh,
yeah...

513
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:39,600
Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh...

514
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,300
Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh

515
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,900
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

516
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,467
Ooh-ooh-ooh

517
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,967
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

518
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:54,367
Ooh-ooh-ooh...

519
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:56,367
Hey.
Is anybody sitting here?

520
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,633
Ooh-ooh-ooh...

521
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,933
Yeah...

522
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,233
Yeah, baby...#

523
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,933
Hey, baby
ta-da-da-da-da...

524
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,867
Ta-da-da da-da dee

525
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,533
Ooh-ooh-ooh

526
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:21,100
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

527
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,667
Ooh-ooh-ooh

528
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,567
Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh

529
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,900
Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh

530
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,900
Ooh-hh...#

531
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,733
How many of you
can identify this note?

532
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,633
You there.
What is the note?

533
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:04,567
A "B?"
B flat!

534
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:08,633
The ability to know any note when
you hear it is great asset.

535
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:13,600
Those of you who don't have it must work
that much harder.

536
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,900
Is the same with your
ability to read music.

537
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,467
Your opportunities
are expanded.

538
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:19,200
If you look
at a piece of music,

539
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:21,600
see how the notes
are arranred on the pare

540
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,133
and hear exactly
what it is,

541
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,967
each note in your head.

542
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,600
This is something you will
learn to do this summer

543
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,067
in your individual studies
with me.

544
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,567
I'm so sorry. That was me.
Are you okay?

545
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,967
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
I'm sorry. That was my fault.

546
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:47,233
I was in the way.
No, it's good. It was my fault.

547
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,300
I should really learn to stand.
Okay.

548
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:57,300
Awesome.

549
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,667
She doesn't even know.

550
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,567
Hey. How's it going?
Couldn't be better.

551
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,300
Should I ask for a single?

552
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,500
Am I bothering you that much?
Hey. Hold up.

553
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,667
I mean, I just get the feeling that
I'm some kinda pain in your butt.

554
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,700
Look, it's not even
like that, all right?

555
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,733
I'm here for that scholarship.

556
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,433
I'm just about hardcore focus.
Well it seems really personal.

557
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,533
Oh, please.
I'm not even trying to hear that.

558
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,033
Look, we're all up against
each other for that money.

559
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
So I just gotta be able
to do my thing

560
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,533
and not get caught up
in any personalities.

561
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:57,433
I don't really mean
nothing by it.

562
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,167
So, we cool?

563
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,100
Yeah. We're cool.
Cool.

564
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,267
Hey, Mr. Torvald.
Hey, Robin.

565
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,767
I wanted to let you know that I tried
those exercises you gave me last summer

566
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,800
and they really helped.
I just wanted to say thank you so much.

567
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,067
My pleasure.

568
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,900
Oh, and I'll have you know
that I'm running for those solos.

569
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,767
Well, I'll keep an eye out for you.
Thank you, Mr. Torvald.

570
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:34,967
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reirneth

571
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,267
Hallelujah,
hallelujah

572
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,667
Hallelujah, hallelujah

573
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:45,267
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reirneth

574
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,467
Hallelujah,
hallelujah

575
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:51,567
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
Ouch and cut.

576
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,600
Sorry, that was me.
Yeah, we know.

577
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,200
And you are?
Terri Fletcher.

578
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,700
thought I recornized you.

579
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:00,767
The girl from the DVD.

580
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:02,800
Terri Fletcher,
the thing is

581
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,867
the theme emerres
from the harmony.

582
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,533
Give me you hand.
Whack!

583
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,800
None of you follow it directly.
Capice?

584
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,667
Good job, Robin.
Whoo-ee!

585
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,700
Okay, let's do it again.

586
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,567
One, two, three, four.

587
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:21,767
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reirneth

588
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,867
Hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah.

589
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,600
Oh.

590
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,300
Sorry, Mr. Wesson.
I was-I forrot my books at the--

591
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,333
Is your time
that was wasted.

592
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,333
Please go to the stand.

593
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,533
Please sight-read
the first pare.

594
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,600
Ca? Ca...

595
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:14,300
Support.

596
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,600
Support with your diaphrarm.

597
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,633
Air goes in.
Diaphrarm goes out.

598
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,833
Is okay to look fat.

599
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,700
Sorry.

600
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,533
Hey.
What's up?

601
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,933
She doesn't,
she doesn't know

602
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
She doesn't--
she doesn't, she doesn't

603
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,067
She doesn't even know,
know, know

604
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:59,700
She-she doesn't
even know, know, know, know

605
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:06,700
Oh!

606
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:13,267
Thanks anyways.

607
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,867
You're a serious weirdo.
You know that?

608
00:42:57,967 --> 00:42:59,967
It isn't lucky
unless it's face up.

609
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:02,567
But now it's just a penny
that thinks it's lucky, but it isn't.

610
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:05,067
Well now it can be lucky
for someone else.

611
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,200
Besides, haven't you ever heard
of making your own luck?

612
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:15,900
Well, what do you know?
A lucky penny.

613
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,600
So, an Enrlishman in L.A.

614
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:32,300
Yeah, my parents put an ocean between
them after the nastiest divorce ever.

615
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,267
No joke, people study it.

616
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:38,633
So, how can you have
a sense of humor about that?

617
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:40,667
My music became
like a relirion.

618
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:42,667
It kept me sane.

619
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:47,533
So, music is your
hirher power.

620
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:50,100
Pretty much.
I mean, look at this.

621
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:52,133
This city.
All these people.

622
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,133
All this life
and music.

623
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,400
I'm gonna make music
for them.

624
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
I can't think
of a better way to spend my life.

625
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,367
Are you missing home?

626
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:08,667
A little bit.

627
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,500
I don't know. It's just been really
tourh lately.

628
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,533
Come on.

629
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,133
I just gave you my
"E! True Hollywood Story."

630
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,500
You gotta
give me something.

631
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:20,533
Um.

632
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,567
Me and my brother
were in a car accident

633
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:26,233
on the day of his graduation.
And, um,

634
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,667
some drunk driver ran
throurh a red light and--

635
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,000
Hey, Terri!
Come here.

636
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,067
Uh, look, Terri,
I've gotta go.

637
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:35,100
I've gotta meet
somebody.

638
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,133
Look, say hi
to Denise for me.

639
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,667
Hey.
Hey, was that Jay running off?

640
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:46,033
Yeah.
Firures. What, was he macking on you?

641
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:48,067
Not that I could tell.

642
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,467
Well, count your blessings,
'cause I know his rame.

643
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,233
He likes to hit
on nice girls.

644
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,633
And baby, you--
you got a lock on that one.

645
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,633
What?
I mean, look at you.

646
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,367
Look at your hair, your clothes,
the way you talk.

647
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,800
You're like some kinda
retro Brady Buncher.

648
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,267
Shoot, I'm not even
trying to hear that.

649
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,333
Okay, that was cute.
My bad.

650
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:13,533
I didn't know
you could do this.

651
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,400
Yeah. My teachers are always harping
about how it's bad for me.

652
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:18,067
You know, how I'm gonna lose my ear.
But I just like how it sounds in here.

653
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,600
Hello.
Oh hi, honey.

654
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,600
Um, Dad wants
to talk to you.

655
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:59,133
Um, Simon, pick up.

656
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,500
Hey, sweetheart.

657
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:03,500
How's it going?
Hanging in there?

658
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:06,267
Yeah, everything's good.
Sure do miss you.

659
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,333
I miss you too, Dad.

660
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,600
What was that? Sounded like a siren.
Uh, no, no. It's nothing.

661
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,167
Well, it didn't sound like nothing.
It sounded pretty close.

662
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,867
The neirhbors are out of town
and their alarm keeps going off

663
00:46:21,933 --> 00:46:23,867
so, I'm gonna go talk
to the police, okay?

664
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:26,533
I'll call you back. All right, bye.
Okay, bye, honey.

665
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,767
Uh, what, Terri, wait.

666
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:30,867
Terri?

667
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:34,067
I'm gonna lose it.

668
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,900
King of Kings

669
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,067
Forever and ever

670
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,067
Hallelujah, hallelujah

671
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:42,067
And Lord of Lords

672
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,100
Forever and ever

673
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,100
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Yes.

674
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,733
King of Kings

675
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,767
Forever and ever

676
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,767
Hallelujah, hallelujah

677
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,800
And Lord of Lords...

678
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:57,200
I can never get that note.
I can't believe this.

679
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,667
I can.
Problem, ladies?

680
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:04,800
Yeah, I think that some of us maybe need
to practice this

681
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,800
a little bit more outside of class.
Meow!

682
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,633
Why don't you let me
worry about that, hmm?

683
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,900
Okay, that's it.
Done for the day.

684
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:14,867
Go on.
Get outta here.

685
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,133
Ms. Fletcher.

686
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:21,533
Okay, I give up.

687
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,033
What did you do
with the girl on the DVD?

688
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,833
Excuse me?

689
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,933
The lively, funny, talented girl,
what did you do with her?

690
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,033
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

691
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,000
I sent my songs on a CD.

692
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:37,367
No, there was also a DVD.

693
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:39,733
It came in late.
We almost didn't see it.

694
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,067
But it's a big part
of the reason why you are here.

695
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:44,067
Sit down.
Be comfortable.

696
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,133
Okay, Mr. Torvald.
I did not send it.

697
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,833
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

698
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,467
No? Well.

699
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:53,067
Let me introduce you
to one interesting, fascinating lady.

700
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,100
Maybe you'll be inspired.

701
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,133
I know we were.

702
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,533
Terri's my sister. And, uh, she's my
favorite person in the whole world.

703
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,667
She like a challenre.
She thrives when she's pushed.

704
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,700
And the people
who can do that,

705
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,767
they don't live
in Flagstaff.

706
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:15,967
Terri deserves a chance
to learn from the best.

707
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:18,500
She's already good.

708
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,500
But she could be great.

709
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,767
If you let her in,
you won't be disappointed.

710
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:54,433
Hey, Terri?

711
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,467
Terri!

712
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,600
Terri.
Are you okay?

713
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,100
Please. It's probably just some
weirdo misfit thing.

714
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,367
No.

715
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:42,333
The show's over.
Okay, you can go now.

716
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,733
Look, whatever it is,
you can't leave.

717
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:52,367
It's copping out.
What are you doing here?

718
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:54,567
Same as everybody else.

719
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:57,467
The music thing.
Ducking a summer job.

720
00:49:57,533 --> 00:50:00,200
I mean here in my doorway.

721
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:02,467
Look, come on.
Let's just get outta here.

722
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,167
Come on.
Let's just go.

723
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:08,300
The bar isn't walking away.

724
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,133
How do I know you won't?

725
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,667
I was sitting
right next to him.

726
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:27,767
And I don't know why.

727
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:31,100
But I miss him.

728
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:34,667
The second I start to feel
like I'm enjoying myself,

729
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:36,700
this voice comes
inside my head and...

730
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,567
it's like,

731
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:42,667
"How can you be having
a good time when Paul is dead?"

732
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,900
You can't blame
yourself like that.

733
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,000
You don't understand.

734
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,000
It was my fault.

735
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:53,033
I got him to sneak out.

736
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,033
I shouldn't
have risked it.

737
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,833
Look, Terri.
Some idiot ran a red light.

738
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,400
It was bad luck.

739
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:06,267
Messed up timing.
That's all.

740
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,967
You weren't there.

741
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:16,200
Look, I can't imarine
what you're going throurh.

742
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,233
But I do know
from experience

743
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,667
backing down can
become a way of life.

744
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:23,667
Don't leave.

745
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:26,633
Screw the pressure.
Screw the scholarship.

746
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,167
I mean, do your own thing
on your own terms.

747
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,167
And get what
you came here for.

748
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:33,833
That's what counts.
But Jay, I'm lying to people.

749
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,833
I mean, I had to lie
to get here.

750
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,333
So what.
You got here.

751
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,167
It's not
suppose to be easy.

752
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:45,500
You're here because you did
what you had to do.

753
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:48,667
Why do you care
so much?

754
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,733
I don't know.

755
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,900
I like you.

756
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:04,733
And Robin fits
into that, how?

757
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,900
We met here
last year and...

758
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:09,400
we had a thing
for a while.

759
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:11,900
That's all over.

760
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:14,400
Does she know that?

761
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,367
Yeah, well...

762
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,400
some people hanr on

763
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:20,400
when they should
just let go.

764
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,667
La-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la

765
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:37,800
La-la-la-la

766
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,133
La-la-la-la

767
00:52:41,267 --> 00:52:43,233
La-la.

768
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:45,700
Thank you.

769
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:48,100
Okay, I'm not doing this
to torture you people.

770
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,167
Just think of this
as a midterm worth,

771
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,667
oh, half your rrade.
Ms. Fletcher?

772
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:54,667
Please?

773
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,100
La-la-la-la-la

774
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,233
La-la-
la-la-la

775
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,533
La-la-la-la-la...

776
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,167
La-la-la-la-la-la

777
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:14,300
Ha-ho

778
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,833
O-o-o-o

779
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,867
O-a-a-a-a-a

780
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:22,000
O-o-o-o-o-o

781
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,100
Hey-a-a-a
yeah-e-a

782
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:31,500
Yeah!
That was great.

783
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,900
All right, you take the top
of the fourth.

784
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:38,433
Awesome.
I was talking to Terri. Bing!

785
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,233
Okay, let's take
the third part from the top.

786
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Is everybody ready?

787
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,500
One, two, three, four

788
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:49,333
Hallelujah,
hallelujah

789
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,267
Hallelujah, hallelujah

790
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,933
Hallelujah.

791
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
Hey.

792
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,567
What's this?

793
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:02,900
I think maybe Giordanni
is not for you.

794
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:06,533
We try something
else, hmm?

795
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,267
You know, I appreciate
the thought, Mr. Wesson,

796
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:12,733
but, you know, I'd really like to stick
to the old one.

797
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,767
I'm feeling much better today
and I wanna see if I can keep it up.

798
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:24,933
Thanks.

799
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:53,233
Hmm.

800
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,667
You and me

801
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,067
Can't you see

802
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:13,067
How our hearts are one?

803
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:20,433
Wha--

804
00:55:21,433 --> 00:55:23,600
What are you doing here?
Oh, uh...

805
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:25,600
just...

806
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,800
the door was open.
I just heard you playing.

807
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:32,200
Oh, don't stop.

808
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:34,200
No, it's, um,
it's okay.

809
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,067
I was, um,
I was finished anyway.

810
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,733
Whatever.

811
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,767
Terri, wait.

812
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:45,033
I'm sorry, I'm just...

813
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,467
a bit weird
when I'm writing.

814
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:50,267
Why?
Well...

815
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,767
I-it's just my lyrics.
They're really lame.

816
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:54,767
I mean, when I sing them.

817
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,933
And I want them to mean
so much more, but--

818
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,967
Well, I've been writing songs
since I was a kid.

819
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:01,000
But my arrangements sound like

820
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:04,867
some cheesy Saturday morning
cartoon or something.

821
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:08,667
Play something for me.
Oh, um.

822
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:11,600
It's not ready yet.
Come on, whatever happened to that...

823
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,800
"You've got to do your own thing
on your own terms"

824
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,500
junk that you gave
me the other day?

825
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,400
Come on.

826
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:20,433
Okay.

827
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,100
You and me
can't you see

828
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:29,067
How our hearts
are one?

829
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:31,200
Please believe

830
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:34,600
And don't deceive

831
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,667
Now our journey's
just berun

832
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:41,500
The sunlight
in your hair

833
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:44,767
Makes my heart jump
in the air...

834
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,967
Come on.
Okay, wait.

835
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:52,400
I like the music a lot.

836
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,533
Yeah?
Okay? But what about this?

837
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,033
Yeah, I like that.
Okay?

838
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,100
It's very cool.

839
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,033
When it comes to rap,
you don't even write your stuff

840
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,333
Yeah you make tracks
but I make twice as much.

841
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,833
Oh, spring, when a younr
man's fancy turns to love.

842
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,500
Did you ruys see that?
What?

843
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:14,067
Oh, it's weird 'cause
there's a hole in my chest

844
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:16,200
where my heart used to be
'cause someone else

845
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:20,733
yanked it out and she doesn't even
frirrin' care that she did it.

846
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,300
Are you talking about the girl in
the black sweatshirt?

847
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,533
Dude, she's the hottest
player here.

848
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,833
I heard her in the practice
rooms and she's flawless.

849
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,467
Well, she looked at me
and I just...

850
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,967
oh, man, snap.

851
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:38,433
Friend, you're hooked.
Hopelessly.

852
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,867
Have you ever even talked to her?
No, I'm working on that.

853
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:43,900
See, the problem is she won't give
me the time of day.

854
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:47,100
Well, why don't l
introduce you ruys?

855
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,367
What if I told you
you were the coolest girl ever?

856
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,600
Jay, I like this girl.
You know how to pick them.

857
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:55,200
I've always said that, haven't I, Jay?
Yeah, he has always said that.

858
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,067
Kiwi seal of approval.

859
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,300
Hi.

860
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:14,500
Hey, I'm Terri.

861
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:15,967
Sorry to bother you.

862
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,633
Your name?

863
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,000
Sloane.

864
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,567
I-I know we don't have
any classes torether or anything, but...

865
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:28,833
um, I just thought
that I'd introduce myself.

866
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:31,400
Okay.

867
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,600
Okay, so there's
this ruy, right?

868
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:40,100
And, um, he's really nice
and his name's Kiwi

869
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,000
and he kinda has a crush on you.
So we were wondering

870
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:45,700
if you wanted to come
hanr out with us on Saturday night?

871
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:48,933
Kiwi's a weird name.

872
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,600
Why would he have a crush on me?
That's stupid.

873
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:57,633
Um, I mean, sometimes there's just
nothing you can do about it.

874
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:01,733
Well, anyway, um, we're gonna meet
in the lobby at 7:00

875
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,133
and, um, we're gonna rrab
a bite to eat, okay?

876
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:10,667
I ruess.

877
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:12,467
Great.

878
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,533
Okay.

879
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,800
Really good.

880
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,567
It's kinda weird talking.
Okay, you think and throw it at.

881
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:34,600
But then, yeah.
You're in.

882
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:38,067
You beautiful
little petunia.

883
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:41,500
You-ah! Ah, sacre bleu! Ah!
I got you, man.

884
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:43,600
Okay, girl.
So talk to me

885
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,600
Now it's you and Jay?

886
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,600
Yeah, kind of.

887
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,600
I mean,
he's really cool.

888
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,600
And what about Robin,
Ms. thing?

889
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:54,333
He says they're over.
Yeah, right.

890
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,333
That's really cute.
Oh, you like this?

891
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Yeah.

892
00:59:57,467 --> 00:59:59,100
My mom, she runs this funky
little clothing shop.

893
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:02,300
She's got great taste.
Really?

894
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,367
Yeah, I just wish business
was better thourh, you know?

895
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,800
I mean, even with me working part-time
barring groceries, and you know,

896
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:09,800
doing what I can
street performing,

897
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:12,300
we still had crazy trouble
scrapping up the tuition.

898
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:15,667
I mean, why do you think I'm stressing
that scholarship?

899
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,667
Hey, come here
for a second.

900
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:19,667
I want you to see
what this looks like.

901
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:20,600
Really?
Yeah, come on.

902
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:24,200
You forced me.

903
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:27,867
Oh yeah, that's fresh.
Oh, do I look like I'm going clubbing?

904
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh my God.

905
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,133
Hey, Aunt Nina.
Terri, thank God I reached you!

906
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,133
Your dad called,
I did my thing.

907
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,733
I think he smells a rat.
I don't know how, I don't know why.

908
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,667
But your mother just called
and said he is on his way here, now!

909
01:00:57,733 --> 01:01:00,733
I'll stall him as best I can but is
there any way you can just get here?

910
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,267
Oh my God.
We're dead.

911
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:06,300
I'm dead.

912
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:09,000
Hey, Jay!

913
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:24,167
Okay, thanks.
Good luck, Terri.

914
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:26,733
I'll see you
tomorrow night, all right?

915
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,767
The desert train is now
boarding on platform 1 2.

916
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:46,300
We're getting a little break
from the 100-plus temperatures

917
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,500
here in the greater
Palm Springs area.

918
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:51,367
Wind's out of the northeast
at six miles per hour.

919
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,333
Hey.
Hey, Nina.

920
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,333
Where is she?

921
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,167
Ah, well, um...

922
01:02:36,233 --> 01:02:38,933
there's something
I wanted to talk to you about, Simon.

923
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,667
Oh yeah.
Yeah, um--

924
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:43,700
Daddy!

925
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,200
I missed you.
Oh, I missed you too.

926
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:57,200
I need a drink.

927
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,000
Sorry.

928
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:06,900
They're not coming, man.
I'm telling you.

929
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,700
They're not showing up.
No way. Look,

930
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,467
women are always
fashionably late.

931
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:14,900
They'll be here.
Okay, they'll be here.

932
01:03:14,967 --> 01:03:16,833
Dude.
Thanks, man.

933
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,867
No, no, no, dude.

934
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,967
Damn it.

935
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:25,667
No, no, wait, wait, wait!
Don't walk away.

936
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,933
Hey, you ruys,
I'm sorry I'm late.

937
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,667
Hey, Sloane,
you look great.

938
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:34,367
Yeah.

939
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:35,733
Come on, let's go.

940
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:39,433
Um, I think
you should-cool.

941
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,533
No, seriously. I had to pretend to my
dad like I had been there

942
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,300
the whole entire time, and meanwhile
my aunt was remodeling her house,

943
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:48,300
so when I went to go find the bathroom,
I walked into a closet.

944
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,233
No way.
Yes way.

945
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,100
Yeah, you know, we all
thought you were like some

946
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:55,700
goody-two-shoes,
but you're like a furitive from the law.

947
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,567
Speaking of which, furitive,
where are you leading us to?

948
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,333
You'll see.

949
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:19,367
She's good.
Beyond, man.

950
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,733
This one, okay?

951
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:35,000
You got a smile
so bright

952
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:38,400
You know you could
have been a candle

953
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:41,267
I'm holding
you so tight...

954
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:45,167
Come on you ruys.
Come on.

955
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:47,167
She's not serious.
Come on.

956
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:50,067
No, no, no.
The way you swept me off my feet

957
01:04:50,133 --> 01:04:53,767
You know you could
have been some perfume

958
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:59,033
Well you could have been
anything that you wanted to

959
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,733
And I could tell

960
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,767
The way you do
the things you do

961
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,800
The way you do
the things you do

962
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:07,333
The way you do the things
you do

963
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:09,800
The way you do
the things you do

964
01:05:09,867 --> 01:05:13,300
And as pretty as you are

965
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,067
You know you could
have been a flower...

966
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:03,733
I like to come up here
sometimes to think.

967
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,833
This is really cool.

968
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,867
I love it up here.

969
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,933
Wish I had a place
to think like this.

970
01:06:12,033 --> 01:06:14,067
Well, you play
your cards right,

971
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,133
maybe I'll share
with you.

972
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:18,167
Maybe?
Maybe.

973
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:21,800
Depends on what you
come up here to think about.

974
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:23,833
Stuff.

975
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,600
My dreams.

976
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:31,367
Music.
The future.

977
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:33,733
If I have one.

978
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:43,967
Come on.

979
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,333
Too fast?

980
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,333
Not ready.

981
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,700
Well... cool.

982
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:10,933
I mean I like you.

983
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,733
A lot.

984
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,200
Yeah, I like you too.

985
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:23,100
I was thinking of that song
we were working on the other day.

986
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,600
Um-hmm.

987
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:27,933
I think we should do it for our final
performance piece.

988
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,367
You sing.
I'll play.

989
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:31,533
We could split
the scholarship

990
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,800
and we could write something
really meaningful.

991
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:38,700
Okay?
Deal.

992
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,433
Do you want
to try that again?

993
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,467
What?

994
01:08:14,733 --> 01:08:17,367
Something in the way
you throw your hair

995
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:19,700
Back over your shoulder

996
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:22,533
Something in the way
you smile

997
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:24,567
When you're looking
my way

998
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,600
I've got no concerns

999
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:29,600
The days are long
and the nights get colder

1000
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:33,100
Because it's this
I've got to try

1001
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:34,767
On you, honey

1002
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,433
I ain't never wishin'
for the chanre

1003
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,300
In my condition

1004
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,067
I'm not rich
but I know

1005
01:08:41,133 --> 01:08:44,100
That the sun
will shine for me

1006
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:45,800
Ride with me

1007
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:50,200
Won't you take
a ride with me?

1008
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:55,200
Let's go, let's go!
Hey, it's open mic night, ruys.

1009
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:02,067
Boo!
You suck!

1010
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:07,000
Tourh crowd.

1011
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

1012
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:11,400
I'm gonna go see if we can get onto
the list to perform.

1013
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:13,400
What?
Jay, no.

1014
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:15,800
Hey look, we can practice forever,
but sooner or later

1015
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:17,733
we're gonna
have to do it.

1016
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,167
We gotta get out of here.

1017
01:09:20,233 --> 01:09:23,800
Hey-ey.

1018
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:25,800
All right,
all right.

1019
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:27,800
Stanley Wilson,
ladies and gentlemen.

1020
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,833
Let's give a big hand
to Stanley Wilson.

1021
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,833
Why are you here?!
You suck, man!

1022
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:33,867
Good job.

1023
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm so nervous.
Well, look, just--

1024
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:38,433
picture the audience naked.

1025
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,600
Okay, bad idea.

1026
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:43,400
All right, next up,
we have Terri and Jay.

1027
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:45,867
Now, it is their first time
here at the Blue Moon,

1028
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:48,700
so let's give them a warm welcome.
Terri and Jay, everyone.

1029
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:05,767
There's a light in me

1030
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,833
And--

1031
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,367
Let me start over.
Come on, sing something!

1032
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:13,467
There's a light in me

1033
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:16,433
Hey, turn around.
And it's shine--

1034
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:19,933
Look, it's okay.
Turn around.

1035
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:24,000
Sorry.

1036
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,633
There's a light in me

1037
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,933
And it's shine--
shine

1038
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,333
I can't help--

1039
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:48,267
Paul!

1040
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:55,900
Terri! Terri!

1041
01:10:55,967 --> 01:10:57,900
Terri, wait, wait!

1042
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:01,067
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

1043
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:04,400
I saw--
I just wasn't ready.

1044
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:09,467
I-I was gonna wait.

1045
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,533
But, um,

1046
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,667
this is for you.

1047
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,733
Paul's cross.

1048
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:55,067
The kingdom
of this world

1049
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:58,067
He is become

1050
01:11:58,133 --> 01:12:01,233
The kingdom of our Lord

1051
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,233
And of His Christ...

1052
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,067
And of His Christ.

1053
01:12:07,133 --> 01:12:09,933
Good. Nice.

1054
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,400
Improving.
We've got 10 minutes left.

1055
01:12:12,467 --> 01:12:14,700
I want to run the third section.
Has anybody seen Terri?

1056
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:17,667
I can sing the part, Mr. Torvald, I know
it backwards and forwards.

1057
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,700
It's Terri's solo,
so lets wait for her.

1058
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:23,700
But she's not even here. And it's not
like she can sing it anyway.

1059
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,533
Terri's worked hard for it.
She deserves it.

1060
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,033
No, I deserve this part!

1061
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,667
Stop it. Jeez.

1062
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,567
Ha-ha.

1063
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,333
Well I ruess you have
a new favorite now!

1064
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,333
Hey.

1065
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,333
Come on.

1066
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,367
Whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

1067
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,967
I don't understand.

1068
01:12:56,067 --> 01:12:58,967
I don't-I don't see how things can
just go from being so great

1069
01:12:59,033 --> 01:13:01,767
one summer to turn
to such crap the next.

1070
01:13:05,533 --> 01:13:07,500
I'm sorry, Robin.

1071
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,933
Can we talk?

1072
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,733
I mean, privately?

1073
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:22,600
Hey, Mr. Torvald.
I'm sorry I missed class.

1074
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,633
Well, that's okay.

1075
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,933
Are you feeling better?

1076
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:30,333
What?
If you missed my class,

1077
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
you must be deathly ill.

1078
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,300
It's too bad because we were gonna
work on your solo today.

1079
01:13:38,467 --> 01:13:41,300
I'm not ready for a solo.
Yes, you are.

1080
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:44,600
Don't you even know how much you've
improved since you've been here?

1081
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:47,267
Okay, but there are much better singers
here, Mr. Torvald.

1082
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,267
I'll be the judre of that.

1083
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,267
We'll try it again tomorrow.

1084
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,467
Look, Terri,

1085
01:13:53,533 --> 01:13:56,467
there's people in the class who are
desperate to do this solo,

1086
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:59,300
so if you don't care
about the work,

1087
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,333
what have you
been doing here?

1088
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:08,233
This is so humiliating.
You're suppose to be with me.

1089
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,333
Look, just--

1090
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,367
take it easy.

1091
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,300
Worse things
have happened, right?

1092
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:19,300
Yeah, all the time.

1093
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:21,300
Just not to me.

1094
01:14:21,367 --> 01:14:24,700
I always get my way.

1095
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:30,367
Is that a bad thing to say?
Well, maybe a little, yeah.

1096
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,100
But I thought you liked bad.

1097
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:37,900
Maybe a little bad?

1098
01:14:37,967 --> 01:14:41,400
Come on, we got along
really well last summer, didn't we?

1099
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,433
People chanre, Robin.

1100
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,767
I'm not the same person
I was last summer.

1101
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,767
Neither are you.

1102
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:49,767
I don't know.

1103
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:52,633
I think we can be those two people
again. Don't you?

1104
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
Hey, have you seen Jay?

1105
01:15:01,467 --> 01:15:03,467
Uh, heading to the practice room,
I think.

1106
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,300
I think I know the problem.

1107
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,633
I'm bad.

1108
01:15:13,233 --> 01:15:15,667
But I can be better.

1109
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,700
Terri, wait!
Terri!

1110
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,100
Terri!
Terri, wait!

1111
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:33,433
Terri!

1112
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,267
Wait.
Jerk!

1113
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:38,767
Terri!

1114
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:43,000
Jay?
Stay away from me! Terri!

1115
01:15:53,733 --> 01:15:55,700
Stupid.

1116
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:16,833
I don't know your face

1117
01:16:16,933 --> 01:16:19,700
No more

1118
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,600
Or feel the touch

1119
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:27,633
That I adore

1120
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:35,233
I don't know your face

1121
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,633
No more

1122
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:43,100
It's just a place

1123
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,200
I'm looking for...

1124
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,500
Terri, come on, please.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

1125
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:54,033
Just back off.

1126
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:57,900
We might as well
be living

1127
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:01,500
In another town

1128
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,667
We might as well

1129
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:08,667
We might
as well

1130
01:17:08,733 --> 01:17:11,367
We might as well

1131
01:17:11,433 --> 01:17:17,833
Be stranrers...

1132
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:28,433
Be stranrers

1133
01:17:30,433 --> 01:17:33,767
For all I know

1134
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:38,433
Of you now

1135
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:42,867
For all I know.

1136
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:48,533
Aw, hey.
You okay?

1137
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:52,200
It's nothing.

1138
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,267
I'm sorry if I was hard
on you the other day.

1139
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,167
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

1140
01:17:57,233 --> 01:18:00,200
if you need anything.
If you want to talk. Anything.

1141
01:18:01,733 --> 01:18:03,700
Okay?

1142
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:11,333
Have you ever lost anyone?

1143
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,433
Yeah.

1144
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:16,533
I just can't let this go.

1145
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,533
Well, you're an artist

1146
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,867
and artists
feel things differently

1147
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:23,533
than rerular people.

1148
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:26,400
Look at Patsy Cline or

1149
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,900
Billie Holiday.
You could hear it in their voice.

1150
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:31,400
Or,

1151
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,600
Vincent van Gorh. Cut off his ear,
but hey, he could paint.

1152
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:37,100
Vincent van Gorh
killed himself.

1153
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:39,533
That's right.
That's a bad example.

1154
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,433
Hey, I'm a music teacher,
not a shrink.

1155
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,100
What do you want?

1156
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,267
I ruess...

1157
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:52,433
what I'm trying to say
is artists convey emotion.

1158
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,567
They make an audience feel
what they're feeling.

1159
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,800
You know, that's
what it's all about, right?

1160
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:02,100
You just have to find a way

1161
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:04,100
to take what's in here

1162
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:06,967
and put it in here.

1163
01:19:13,867 --> 01:19:16,300
What the hell. Who is it?

1164
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:19,067
It's Jay.
Let me in!

1165
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:21,433
Go away, you jackass!
No, no, no!

1166
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,033
I just-please, I just want
to talk to Terri, okay?

1167
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,700
Just let me in.
He sounds drunk.

1168
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:28,733
Uh, you think?

1169
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,033
Hey, girl,
do not open that door.

1170
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,633
Okay, I'm gonna make
him leave, all right?

1171
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:35,667
Jay, you have to leave now.

1172
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:37,167
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay?

1173
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:39,633
No!
Ow!

1174
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,967
That hurt a lot.

1175
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:45,267
Shh.
No, it's not what you think.

1176
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,767
What's going on?!

1177
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,767
I saw you kissing her, okay?
No, no.

1178
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,900
Shut up!
You shut up!

1179
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:52,900
Come on, Terri.
I'm trying to sleep.

1180
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:55,967
Sh-I wasn't kissing her.
She was-she was kissing me.

1181
01:19:56,033 --> 01:19:58,100
Oh no. He didn't even try
to go there, please.

1182
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,100
I'm sure that makes
a lot of sense, Jay,

1183
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:02,133
when you're drunk.
Terri,

1184
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,133
I don't care about her.

1185
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:07,167
I care about you.
Boy, who you trying to play?

1186
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:10,600
Terri?
Denise, just chill out, all right?

1187
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,133
Look, Terri,

1188
01:20:13,233 --> 01:20:15,167
I care about you.

1189
01:20:15,233 --> 01:20:17,467
You know I do.
Why would you do that?

1190
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:20,200
Why would you drink?

1191
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:26,233
Because, because I'm--
I'm worthless.

1192
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:30,000
You know what? Don't even try and give
me that self-pity thing, okay?

1193
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:31,967
Terri, look.
Y'all need to relocate.

1194
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:34,733
Okay, well, I'm never going to get him
past the night ruard, so you--

1195
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,800
I'll be fine. I'll just--
You have--

1196
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,400
You have to help me
get him up to the roof.

1197
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,267
This is too much
drama for me.

1198
01:20:41,367 --> 01:20:43,300
Shh-hh.
I'm fine.

1199
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:45,667
You're not fine, okay?

1200
01:20:45,733 --> 01:20:47,667
Oh wow!

1201
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:51,400
I love this roof!
It's so cool.

1202
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:54,067
Whoo!
Oh, his breath is nasty.

1203
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:56,067
Oh!

1204
01:20:56,133 --> 01:20:58,067
I'm spinning.

1205
01:20:58,133 --> 01:21:00,567
Help him!

1206
01:21:00,633 --> 01:21:02,567
Oh my God.

1207
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:04,567
I'm out.

1208
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:06,567
Thank you.

1209
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:09,600
What did you do?
I don't feel so good.

1210
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,033
I'm sure you don't.

1211
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:14,767
In a moment

1212
01:21:14,867 --> 01:21:18,300
Everything can chanre

1213
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,400
Feel the wind
on your shoulder

1214
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:24,733
For a minute

1215
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,267
All the world can wait

1216
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:32,667
Let go of your yesterday
Wake up.

1217
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:35,333
Can you hear it calling?

1218
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,167
Can you feel it
in your soul?

1219
01:21:38,233 --> 01:21:41,667
Can you trust this longing
Wake up, it's a new day.

1220
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:44,000
And take control?

1221
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,167
Fly

1222
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,333
Open up the part of you

1223
01:21:48,467 --> 01:21:52,333
'Cause it's your time

1224
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,200
Time to fly...

1225
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:04,233
I'm really sorry.

1226
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,733
Save it.
You're not forgiven yet.

1227
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,500
Come on, let's go.

1228
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,600
In a moment

1229
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:22,533
Everything can chanre.

1230
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,667
Frances!
Do you have the car keys?

1231
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,767
Frances?

1232
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,933
Car keys?

1233
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,700
Frances?

1234
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,300
So I wrote some new lyrics
and now all we have to do is practice,

1235
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,233
so we can pull this off.
right.

1236
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:00,200
Here's the music.

1237
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,000
Okay, well,
let's start here.

1238
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,433
I wanna work on the bridre.
Okay.

1239
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:14,400
It doesn't matter
what people say

1240
01:23:14,467 --> 01:23:18,533
And it doesn't matter
how long it takes

1241
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,667
Believe in yourself
and you'll fly--

1242
01:23:23,767 --> 01:23:25,800
Okay.

1243
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:29,500
It's not-let's, um, go again
and try it a little faster.

1244
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,567
Okay.
Okay.

1245
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:33,300
It doesn't--

1246
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:38,367
Stop.

1247
01:23:38,433 --> 01:23:40,067
Okay, for real this time.
Let's go.

1248
01:23:43,533 --> 01:23:47,300
It doesn't matter
what people say--

1249
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:50,567
It sounded fine
the first time.

1250
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:53,267
Okay, but "fine" is not going to win us
the scholarship.

1251
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,900
Okay, it's gotta be right.

1252
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,867
And I'm not gonna give up
until I nail it.

1253
01:23:56,933 --> 01:23:58,933
It'll drive me nuts.

1254
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,100
It doesn't matter--
it doesn't matter

1255
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,767
It doesn't matter
how long it takes

1256
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:12,100
Believe in yourself
and you'll fly hirh.

1257
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,600
What?
You did what?

1258
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,433
She got accepted, Simon.

1259
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,433
Out of all the applicants
in America,

1260
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,967
our Terri got in.

1261
01:24:21,033 --> 01:24:23,600
You mean she's been there
this whole time?

1262
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:25,600
Did you hear me?
You-you lied to me?

1263
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:27,767
Did you hear? Our daughter...
You and Nina?

1264
01:24:27,867 --> 01:24:29,767
got into the best
music school in the country.

1265
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:33,400
All of you lied to me.
All of you.

1266
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,200
But Terri wanted to go.

1267
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:40,200
Paul wanted her to go.

1268
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:41,700
Paul!

1269
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:45,933
Terri's singing again.
Why doesn't this matter to you?

1270
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,800
What in God's name
is wrong with you, Frances?

1271
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:53,167
What's wrong with me?

1272
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:55,000
We just lost our son.

1273
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:59,267
We were losing the only
child we have left.

1274
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,300
I'm not gonna let
that happen.

1275
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,333
That's my point.

1276
01:25:03,433 --> 01:25:06,700
She's just a child.
She's our child.

1277
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,733
And how can I protect her
if she's not here?

1278
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:12,733
I want her home.

1279
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,767
I want her home now.

1280
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,233
Will you shut up in here?!

1281
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,900
You are the loudest,
noisiest, rudest jerk on the planet!

1282
01:26:56,433 --> 01:26:58,100
Oh, ow!
Sorry.

1283
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:26,633
Thank you.

1284
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,067
Thank you and welcome.

1285
01:27:30,133 --> 01:27:32,533
Well, it's time to bring
things to a close.

1286
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,933
It's been great fun and we have even
more in store for you.

1287
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,067
Today we have a full slate
of final performances.

1288
01:27:39,133 --> 01:27:42,200
And some of our performers
will be backed up by members

1289
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:44,567
of the Bristol-Hillman
House Band.

1290
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:46,733
Oh my God!

1291
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,233
What?
I don't have Paul's necklace.

1292
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:52,267
No, I can't do this
without him.

1293
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,000
Terri? Terri, wait.
No, uh, don't worry. I'll be back.

1294
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,667
And give a hand to our first performer,
Miss Robin Childers.

1295
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,700
All right!
Yeah!

1296
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,800
Let your body move
on the dance floor

1297
01:28:16,867 --> 01:28:20,700
Feel the rhythm
as your body rets warm...

1298
01:28:23,033 --> 01:28:25,500
Dad?
Pack your things, Terri.

1299
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,100
Let's go home.
Daddy, no!

1300
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,033
Not a word, Theresa.
Just do it.

1301
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,933
Your mother's waiting
downstairs.

1302
01:28:34,033 --> 01:28:35,800
Uh-uh--

1303
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:37,533
Just as you head
is spinning

1304
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,567
As you slowly start
to lose control.

1305
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:46,400
Go, Robin!

1306
01:28:50,267 --> 01:28:52,667
Thank you.
Great performance!

1307
01:28:52,733 --> 01:28:55,700
Our next performer
is Mr. Enrelbert Wilson.

1308
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,233
Enrelbert?

1309
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,267
Come on out, boy!

1310
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:02,800
Kiwi!

1311
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,300
Did you hear what I said?
Pack your things.

1312
01:29:05,367 --> 01:29:08,800
Dad, you know what? You did this to Paul
and now you're doing this to me.

1313
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,700
Don't you dare
bring Paul into this.

1314
01:29:10,767 --> 01:29:12,633
Okay, well, I'm not gonna
let you hold me back.

1315
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,733
You lied to me, Terri.
And I'm sorry about that.

1316
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,500
But I did what
I had to do.

1317
01:29:17,567 --> 01:29:21,733
Okay, you don't listen
to anybody, and we're all afraid of you.

1318
01:29:28,033 --> 01:29:30,233
She doesn't even know!

1319
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,933
She wants the creature
from outer space

1320
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:45,633
Gentlemen

1321
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:57,400
Time is running out.

1322
01:29:57,467 --> 01:29:59,733
Dad...

1323
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:04,067
this place is the scariest,
hardest

1324
01:30:04,133 --> 01:30:06,733
best thing that has ever
happened to me,

1325
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:08,433
no matter how I got here.

1326
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:10,900
We'll discuss it at home.

1327
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:28,900
I'm not leaving.

1328
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:31,733
Okay, I did this

1329
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,033
and I did this for me and I'm gonna
finish it for me.

1330
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,933
You can take me home
if you want to, Dad.

1331
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,767
But I'm performing
any minute now,

1332
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:45,367
and it would mean the world to me if you
and Mom were there to support me.

1333
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,467
I worked so hard here.

1334
01:30:49,533 --> 01:30:51,633
And I'm really good.

1335
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,667
I want you to hear me.

1336
01:30:53,733 --> 01:30:55,300
Please, Dad.

1337
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:01,133
Please, let me stay.

1338
01:31:39,467 --> 01:31:41,633
All right, Denise!
Yes!

1339
01:31:43,033 --> 01:31:47,600
Yes, that was
wonderful, Denise.

1340
01:31:50,233 --> 01:31:52,200
Nice job, Denise!
Thanks.

1341
01:31:52,267 --> 01:31:53,700
You were great, girl!

1342
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:56,067
And now last,
but not least,

1343
01:31:56,133 --> 01:31:59,167
Theresa Fletcher
and Jay Corran.

1344
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:15,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to announce--

1345
01:32:47,433 --> 01:32:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my sincere pleasure

1346
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,033
to present to you the distinctive vocal
stylings of the one,

1347
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:56,333
the only,
Terri Fletcher!

1348
01:33:02,767 --> 01:33:04,733
Um--

1349
01:33:07,267 --> 01:33:09,500
this song Jay
and I wrote torether,

1350
01:33:09,567 --> 01:33:11,500
and, um, I would
like to dedicate it

1351
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:13,800
to my brother,
Paul Fletcher.

1352
01:33:29,533 --> 01:33:33,100
I found myself today

1353
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:38,933
Oh I found myself
and ran away

1354
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:45,333
But something
pulled me back

1355
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:51,133
The voice of reason,
I forrot I had

1356
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:55,633
All I know
is you're not here to say

1357
01:33:55,733 --> 01:33:58,667
What you always
used to say

1358
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:05,133
But it's written
in the sky tonight

1359
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:08,700
So I won't give up

1360
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,933
No, I won't break down

1361
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,400
Sooner than it seems
life turns around

1362
01:34:17,467 --> 01:34:24,033
And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong

1363
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:30,367
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1364
01:34:30,467 --> 01:34:36,067
Someone's watching over me

1365
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:41,933
I've seen
that bright light

1366
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,633
And it's shining
on my destiny

1367
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:54,567
Shining all the time,
and I won't be afraid

1368
01:34:54,633 --> 01:35:00,600
To follow everywhere
it's taking me

1369
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:05,233
All I know
is yesterday is rone

1370
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:08,633
And right now
I belong

1371
01:35:08,733 --> 01:35:14,400
To this moment,
to my dreams

1372
01:35:14,467 --> 01:35:17,433
So I won't give up

1373
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,800
No, I won't break down

1374
01:35:20,867 --> 01:35:22,200
Sooner then it seems
life turns around

1375
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:33,400
And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong

1376
01:35:33,467 --> 01:35:40,233
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1377
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:44,867
Someone's watching over me

1378
01:35:44,967 --> 01:35:47,967
It doesn't matter
what people say

1379
01:35:48,067 --> 01:35:51,067
And it doesn't matter
how long it takes

1380
01:35:51,133 --> 01:35:57,200
Believe in yourself
and you'll fly hirh

1381
01:35:57,267 --> 01:36:00,367
And it only matters
how true you are

1382
01:36:00,433 --> 01:36:07,300
Be true to yourself
and follow your heart

1383
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:11,233
So I won't give up

1384
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:14,567
No, I won't break down

1385
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:21,067
Sooner than it seems
life turns around

1386
01:36:21,133 --> 01:36:26,833
And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong

1387
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:33,467
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1388
01:36:33,533 --> 01:36:36,700
That I won't give up

1389
01:36:36,767 --> 01:36:39,767
No, I won't break down

1390
01:36:39,867 --> 01:36:46,067
Sooner than it seems
life turns around

1391
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:52,200
And I will be strong
even when it all goes wrong

1392
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:58,367
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1393
01:36:58,433 --> 01:37:02,433
That someone's
watching over--

1394
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,133
Someone's
watching over--

1395
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:10,500
Someone's
watching over me

1396
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:14,533
Oh yeah,
oh, oh

1397
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,633
Oh, o-oh

1398
01:37:17,733 --> 01:37:21,200
Oh, oh...

1399
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:24,233
Oh, oh

1400
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,767
Oh, o-oh

1401
01:37:26,867 --> 01:37:30,233
Oh, oh...

1402
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:33,567
Oh, oh

1403
01:37:33,633 --> 01:37:38,833
Someone's watching over me.

1404
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:57,133
Way to go, Terri!

1405
01:38:12,233 --> 01:38:14,700
You did it! You were awesome!
We did it!

1406
01:38:14,767 --> 01:38:17,433
Nothing will ever top
what I just felt.

1407
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,300
We got it.
We got it?

1408
01:38:19,367 --> 01:38:21,000
Are you sure?
All right.

1409
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,200
Each year we present
a $10,000 academic scholarship

1410
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:33,267
in Music Studies to an outstanding
student in the summer music prorram.

1411
01:38:33,367 --> 01:38:36,433
This year's prorram
was better than most,

1412
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,767
full of talented,
hardworking students.

1413
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:41,400
It's a shame we only have
one scholarship to give.

1414
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:45,133
So without further ado,
the board of directors

1415
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,367
of the Bristol-Hillman
Music Conservatory

1416
01:38:47,433 --> 01:38:51,667
is pleased to present
this scholarship to...

1417
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:55,833
Denise Gilmore.

1418
01:39:39,467 --> 01:39:43,900
Oh honey! You were so wonderful!
Oh, thank you!

1419
01:39:43,967 --> 01:39:46,967
Truly amazing, but then again,
it's in the renes.

1420
01:39:47,033 --> 01:39:49,633
Aunt Nina, thank you
for everything.

1421
01:39:52,067 --> 01:39:54,267
I wish you would
have won that scholarship.

1422
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,133
No, Mom, it doesn't
even matter.

1423
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,833
I just-I got to be up there,
you know?

1424
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,400
Yeah.
You um...

1425
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,167
you were great, Terri.
Really.

1426
01:40:04,267 --> 01:40:05,967
Thank you, Dad.

1427
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:08,733
Let me talk to you
for a second alone, all right?

1428
01:40:16,067 --> 01:40:17,467
I uh--

1429
01:40:17,533 --> 01:40:19,300
I just want to tell
you I was wrong.

1430
01:40:19,367 --> 01:40:21,233
No, you know what, Dad?
I should have never--

1431
01:40:25,067 --> 01:40:26,833
I just-I was wrong.

1432
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:30,000
I can just be, uh, pretty hardheaded
sometimes, you know?

1433
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:33,567
Anyway, I just wanted
to tell you that, uh...

1434
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,767
it was probably the proudest
moment of my life

1435
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:40,300
seeing you up there.

1436
01:40:42,267 --> 01:40:44,400
I just wish Paul
could have seen it.

1437
01:40:46,633 --> 01:40:48,067
Me too.

1438
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:59,100
Hi.

1439
01:40:59,167 --> 01:41:01,667
The Fletchers have
an amazing daughter.

1440
01:41:01,733 --> 01:41:03,533
Thank you.
Awesome.

1441
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,133
We hope, uh, we see
her next year.

1442
01:41:08,133 --> 01:41:09,833
Well, you just might.

1443
01:41:09,933 --> 01:41:11,767
Good.

1444
01:41:20,467 --> 01:41:22,633
Hey, Terri.
Come on!

1445
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:37,367
In this place
that has no name

1446
01:41:37,433 --> 01:41:40,133
I can't remember
why I came

1447
01:41:41,467 --> 01:41:44,700
And then I hear
you whispering

1448
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,733
One more mile
to Jericho

1449
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,867
Nothing is ever
what it seems

1450
01:41:51,967 --> 01:41:56,367
When you live
inside your dreams

1451
01:41:56,433 --> 01:42:00,933
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1452
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,767
But I'm not
going to cry

1453
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:09,100
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1454
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:13,933
If we ever say goodbye

1455
01:42:21,267 --> 01:42:25,033
Everybody rets the joke

1456
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:28,167
Where's the fire?
Where's the smoke?

1457
01:42:29,233 --> 01:42:32,467
Money, love and jealousy

1458
01:42:32,533 --> 01:42:36,300
Something's got ahold of me

1459
01:42:36,367 --> 01:42:40,700
But I will follow
where you go

1460
01:42:40,767 --> 01:42:44,233
One more mile to Jericho

1461
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:49,167
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1462
01:42:49,267 --> 01:42:52,133
But I'm not gonna cry

1463
01:42:52,233 --> 01:42:57,167
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1464
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:02,667
If we ever say goodbye

1465
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:07,667
Goodbye now

1466
01:43:07,733 --> 01:43:11,667
Goodbye

1467
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,933
One more mile,
one more kiss

1468
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,633
One more word,
one more wish

1469
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:33,000
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1470
01:43:33,067 --> 01:43:36,500
But I'm not gonna cry

1471
01:43:36,567 --> 01:43:40,833
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1472
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:44,367
If we ever say goodbye

1473
01:43:44,433 --> 01:43:48,767
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1474
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:52,200
But I'm not gonna cry

1475
01:43:52,267 --> 01:43:57,067
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1476
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:01,200
If we ever say goodbye

1477
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:04,600
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1478
01:44:04,667 --> 01:44:10,300
If we ever say goodbye

1479
01:44:10,367 --> 01:44:12,900
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1480
01:44:12,967 --> 01:44:17,633
If we ever say goodbye

1481
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:21,033
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1482
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:25,433
If we ever say goodbye

1483
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:29,267
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1484
01:44:29,367 --> 01:44:34,333
If we ever say goodbye.
