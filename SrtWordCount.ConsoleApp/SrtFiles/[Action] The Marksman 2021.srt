1
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:29,951
Come on, Jackson.

2
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,430
Sorry, girl.

3
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:11,033
BP, this is Jim Hanson.

4
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,704
I've got 4 or 5 IA's

5
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:16,789
heading north out near my ranch,

6
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,459
about a half-mile from the fence.

7
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,501
Over.

8
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,755
Copy that, Jim.

9
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,257
Agents on the way.

10
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:42,132
Water.

11
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:52,868
Easy. Easy.

12
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,372
Hanson here. Better send a medic out.

13
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,249
Found one left behind. Over.

14
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,189
You James Hanson?

15
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,358
Who's asking?

16
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,111
Carl Neeham, from Pima
County Merchants Bank.

17
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:14,075
It's a Notice of Trustee's sale.

18
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,827
Let you know that the ranch is
to be sold at auction in 90 days.

19
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,371
What?

20
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,165
Law requires you be notified.

21
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,792
I'd have called, but I couldn't
find a phone listing for you.

22
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,837
I was in last month, explained
my situation to Ned Fremont.

23
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,088
- He assured me...
- Yes, well,

24
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,506
Ned's no longer with us.

25
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:30,383
Not sure why he didn't follow it,

26
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,719
but bank policy is to take action

27
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,721
if there hasn't been a
payment in over 6 months.

28
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:36,973
You should also know, Mr. Hanson,

29
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,602
that the bank has the right to sell
the property before those 90 days

30
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:41,895
if it receives a reasonable
offer from a third party.

31
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:47,693
Uh...

32
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,487
Mr. Hanson?

33
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,989
That hill over there...

34
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:56,784
Spread my wife's ashes
on top of it last year.

35
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,540
I'm sorry for your loss.

36
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,583
- Look, Mister...
- Neeham.

37
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,586
I'm no deadbeat.

38
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:09,256
I just a need a little time to
sort things out, get back on track.

39
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,676
Yeah, like I said, you've got
90 days, you know, most likely.

40
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,763
Um, my number's on there
if you have any questions.

41
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,265
You have yourself a good evening.

42
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:29,401
Frame's almost built, and I
got to watch my budget and all.

43
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,654
Anyway, don't you have a ranch to run?

44
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,239
Sold most of it off.

45
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,907
Down to the last few head of cattle.

46
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:39,161
Christine's medical bills wiped me out.

47
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,746
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

48
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:45,251
I can dig that hole for you.
It'll be done by sundown.

49
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,882
I wouldn't be asking if
I didn't need the job.

50
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,552
Look, Jim, that kind of
work is not for someone...

51
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,471
Someone my age? Come on, Randall.

52
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:59,223
You know I can outwork any man here.

53
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,852
Listen, I got a new
project starting next month.

54
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,354
Come see me then, I'll see
what I can find for you, okay?

55
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:08,023
Yeah. Okay.

56
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:15,574
I was out your way last week.

57
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,451
Things are looking mighty lean.

58
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:19,619
Tell me about it.

59
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:22,747
At 70 cents per pound,

60
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,084
- we're talking 17 grand.
- Ah.

61
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:28,753
Could you make it 20?

62
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,173
There's not a lot of profit selling
underweight cattle, you know.

63
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm sorry, Jim.

64
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:38,680
Let me know what you decide, buddy.

65
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,752
Sorry to bother you, Sarah.
I thought you'd want to know.

66
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,212
I appreciate it, Angie.

67
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:13,256
Yeah. It's been a long time
since I've seen him here.

68
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,930
Hey, there, stranger.

69
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,017
Hey, Sarah.

70
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:27,687
- This seat taken?
- It's for you.

71
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:29,940
Drink?

72
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:31,734
Mmm-mmm. No, thanks.

73
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:35,320
- Thanks for the call yesterday.
- Mmm.

74
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:39,116
A few more hours, that fella
would've been one for the coroner.

75
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:41,284
His lucky day, I guess.

76
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,788
Not sure he sees it that way.

77
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:47,625
Walked all the way from Honduras,

78
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,627
spent his life savings on a coyote

79
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,920
who left him in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,089
All for naught.

81
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:56,467
Yeah, it's a cruel world.

82
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:01,847
That pass has kept us busy all week.

83
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,975
The cartels are running
everything through there.

84
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,144
Drugs, people, guns.

85
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:08,979
What else is new?

86
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,565
I worry about you,

87
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,402
out there on the front
lines, all by yourself.

88
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:18,656
It would be fine if the government
would get its shit together

89
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:20,408
and figure that mess out.

90
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:28,166
What is going on?

91
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,585
What are you doing back here?

92
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:37,300
Been wondering that myself.

93
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,636
What the hell am I doing?

94
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:45,558
I guess I'm trying to understand

95
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,976
how you work your whole life,

96
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:49,562
serve your country, pay your taxes,

97
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,523
and end up without a pot to piss in.

98
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,319
Lost my home,

99
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:57,862
my livelihood,

100
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,827
and the only person that
made any of it worthwhile.

101
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,337
Come on, let's... let's get you back.

102
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,508
Come on.

103
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:26,891
There we go.

104
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:45,118
Leave it, Sarah. Just leave it.

105
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:57,589
Ah.

106
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,138
I like to remember her like this.

107
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,015
Smiling, laughing.

108
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,480
I've never seen my mom so happy
as the day she married you.

109
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:16,984
Wasn't right, her going
out the way she did.

110
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,070
Watching her suffer like that.

111
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:23,949
I couldn't imagine anything worse.

112
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,868
Now I know.

113
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,040
Come on.

114
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,043
Let's get you to bed.

115
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:39,840
Come on, Pops.

116
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,219
Rest these old bones.

117
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:55,189
It wasn't right, Sarah.

118
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,402
I miss her, too.

119
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:00,944
Yeah?

120
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,203
Rest up.

121
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:10,455
Yeah.

122
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,127
Let's go, let's go.

123
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,026
Who's the best dog in the world?

124
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:15,147
Mom.

125
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:52,034
Who's a good boy?

126
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,663
Jackson is. Jackie...

127
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:59,083
Jeez.

128
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,132
Hey, hey! Wait, wait!

129
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,386
You're never going to make
it through there like that.

130
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,138
It's miles to the nearest road.

131
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:13,206
Do you understand?

132
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,559
You... You will help us?

133
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,686
I'll call the Border Patrol.

134
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:20,020
No! Sir, sir, sir, please! Please!

135
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:21,773
No. No Border Patrol.

136
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,819
I pay you.

137
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:28,155
What?

138
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,073
To help us, I pay you.

139
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,117
I'm not a smuggler, lady.

140
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,826
Border Patrol will help you out.

141
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,870
- No!
- Listen, get you to a doctor.

142
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,830
Please, sir! No, no!

143
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,211
Please. Please!

144
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,006
Please!

145
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,049
Dispatch, this is Jim Hanson.

146
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:50,469
Go ahead, Jim.

147
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:52,929
I've got two IAs,

148
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,973
about a klick south of Stone Ridge.

149
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,059
Copy that.

150
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,561
We're spread thin right now.

151
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:00,854
It'll be a few.

152
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:01,897
10-4.

153
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,108
I'll get you some water.

154
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:05,884
Mom.

155
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,033
Jackson, stay.

156
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:25,779
Speak in English.

157
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,384
I come here to
take the woman and the boy.

158
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,971
Sorry, Pancho. These illegals are mine.

159
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,142
You are Border Patrol?

160
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:41,395
Marine Corps.

161
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:46,900
So you are keeping your country safe

162
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:49,820
all by yourself, huh, Marine Corps?

163
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,947
Something like that.

164
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,372
I am a soldier, too.

165
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:06,379
You're no soldier.

166
00:19:07,922 --> 00:19:09,298
And I don't scare easy.

167
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,426
Now I've already called the cavalry,

168
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:16,222
so I suggest y'all just
turn around and adiós.

169
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,480
I am not going to ask again.

170
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,608
The woman and the boy.

171
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,110
Hand them over.

172
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:35,867
This ain't worth it, boys.

173
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:40,706
Give them to me!

174
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,608
Get in the truck. Move.

175
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,163
Mom! Mom!

176
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:41,600
Oh, shit.

177
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,643
Stay down.

178
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,356
Jackson, quiet.

179
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:48,440
Jackson!

180
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:51,109
Dispatch, this is Hanson.

181
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,736
I've just taken heavy fire.

182
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:53,862
I've got a wounded...

183
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:25,628
Boss.

184
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:59,803
Okay, let's...

185
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,223
Nice and easy.

186
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:06,978
Sir...

187
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,023
They take him, they kill him.

188
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:13,109
No, look, those guys
are gone. They're gone.

189
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,611
No, please.

190
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,738
All I have...

191
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:19,115
It's yours... To help him.

192
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:23,036
This...

193
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:25,997
My cousin...

194
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:28,249
In Chicago.

195
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:31,712
Please.

196
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:32,755
Mamá.

197
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,449
Sir...

198
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,743
Please.

199
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,204
Please.

200
00:23:07,831 --> 00:23:09,542
Mamá.

201
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,959
Mamá.

202
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,299
It doesn't make sense.

203
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,593
No point trying to understand the cartels.

204
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,052
Better just to avoid them.

205
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:04,430
What's going to happen to the kid?

206
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:08,225
Unaccompanied minors are
sent to holding in Nogales.

207
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:11,312
He most likely will end up in foster care.

208
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:15,609
Diaz.

209
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,027
What was the boy talking about?

210
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:23,073
He said if you hadn't stopped them,

211
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:24,701
his mother would still be alive.

212
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,290
Hey, he's just a kid.

213
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:38,798
Jim, I need you to come by the
station and make a statement.

214
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,237
Good boy, Jackson.

215
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,482
Good morning, babe.

216
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,530
Get some grub, huh?

217
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:44,072
Let's get some grub.

218
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:47,720
Good boy.

219
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:12,036
All I have is yours.

220
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:14,080
They take him, they kill him.

221
00:27:14,122 --> 00:27:15,666
Please. Please.

222
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:16,958
God damn it!

223
00:28:07,842 --> 00:28:11,930
Denny, that kid whose
mother died last night,

224
00:28:11,972 --> 00:28:14,183
has he been sent on to Nogales yet?

225
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:16,518
No, he's being deported.

226
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,728
What?

227
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,897
Mexican authorities say he's got a relative

228
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:21,523
waiting for him on the other side.

229
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:25,444
Uh, I need to see him.

230
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,905
Sorry, Jim, can't do that.

231
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:29,448
Just a few minutes.

232
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,949
I already cleared it with Sarah.

233
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,117
Call her and check.

234
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,757
- Make it quick.
- Thanks.

235
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,473
Psst! Hey, come on.

236
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,770
You're not safe here, comprende?

237
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:00,522
Let's go, come on.

238
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:36,849
Come on.

239
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,667
Hey.

240
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,462
Stay here, understand?

241
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,298
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

242
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,422
God damn it.

243
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:40,933
Gentlemen.

244
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,935
Passports and visas, please.

245
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,401
Open the back, please.

246
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,213
All clear!

247
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:16,994
Go ahead.

248
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,659
- What the hell you doing?
- Let me go.

249
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:42,287
Listen to me or you're
going to get yourself killed.

250
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,664
They send you back, those
men are there waiting for you.

251
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:45,440
Understand?

252
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:48,126
Come on.

253
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,787
What?

254
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:28,417
I'm doing what your mother asked.

255
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,002
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.

256
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:34,715
You know, Chicago?

257
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:36,659
Family.

258
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:43,139
Hell, you don't understand
a damn word I'm saying.

259
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:01,238
Hey, you hungry?

260
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:03,991
Thirsty?

261
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:06,535
Food. Uh...

262
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:07,787
Comida.

263
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:09,037
Yeah?

264
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:15,503
Mmm...

265
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,885
Hey. What's the matter?
You got to be hungry.

266
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:43,490
That's what I thought.

267
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,415
- Hey.
- Hello.

268
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,752
I need to buy an atlas.

269
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:38,294
- A what?
- An atlas.

270
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:41,381
Like a map book. With all the states.

271
00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:46,094
Uh, you could try looking on
that bottom left shelf over there.

272
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,264
We don't really sell maps much anymore.

273
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:52,016
Everyone pretty much just
googles it on their phone.

274
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:54,687
Hey, hey!

275
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,312
Huh!

276
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:57,481
My lucky day.

277
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:58,524
How about that?

278
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:01,943
You going on a road trip?

279
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:03,571
Yeah, something like that.

280
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,657
There's no price on this.

281
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:08,659
It's probably outdated.

282
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,452
You can have it on the house.

283
00:38:10,494 --> 00:38:11,995
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

284
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,081
Thank you.

285
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,958
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

286
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,091
Sarah Reynolds.

287
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,384
Sarah, it's Jim.

288
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:09,345
Thank God.

289
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:11,055
You all right?

290
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:12,348
Yeah, I'm fine.

291
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,559
Just called to tell you not to worry.

292
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:16,936
What the hell were you
thinking, taking that kid?

293
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:20,022
They were going to kill him,
the ones who killed his mother.

294
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,400
They were waiting for him at the border.

295
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:25,110
So you don't come to me
with that information?

296
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:26,946
You just take him and leave?

297
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:29,616
Christ, Jim, you put
my ass on the line here.

298
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,119
I can only keep this
thing quiet for so long.

299
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,039
I need you to bring back that kid.

300
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:38,416
Now.

301
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,252
I... I can't do that.

302
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:41,670
Why not?

303
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,630
His mom, she...

304
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:45,298
We made, like, a deal.

305
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,551
Jim...

306
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:49,802
Listen.

307
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:52,514
We sent agents up to your house.

308
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,432
It was burned to the ground.

309
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:58,270
Whoever these guys were at the
border, they're not messing around.

310
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,522
Now tell me where the hell you are.

311
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,941
I'll call you later.

312
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,817
Jim...

313
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:12,075
God damn it!

314
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:15,495
Why the hell did you
have to cross my property?

315
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:18,540
You damn well ought to
appreciate what I'm doing for you.

316
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:24,004
I don't even want
to be in your stupid country.

317
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,555
Well, well, well. He speaks.

318
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,560
Hey, Jackson, you hear that?

319
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,121
I want to go home.

320
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:02,250
Look, it's not safe for you there.

321
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,960
Why are you doing this?

322
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:05,879
Because your mother asked me to help.

323
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,131
Why did you call the Border Patrol on us?

324
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:10,760
Because I didn't want to
find your bodies on my land.

325
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,679
If you want to help me,
you could take me back.

326
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,348
I'll find my own way home.

327
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,476
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.

328
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,894
After that, I don't
give a shit what you do.

329
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,982
Look...

330
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:30,488
It may not seem like it right
now, but this is what's best.

331
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,535
And I'm sorry.

332
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,663
I'm sorry what happened
to your mom and all.

333
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,504
Shit.

334
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,108
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.

335
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:11,638
Do you speak Spanish, queen?

336
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:13,740
No, sorry.

337
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:14,783
Mmm.

338
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:21,038
I come here
looking for a man and a boy.

339
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,041
And they drive a, uh...

340
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:25,877
Truck... Tsk!

341
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,754
A pickup truck.

342
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,088
Yeah, he was here.

343
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,090
He was on a road trip.

344
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,384
You know where?

345
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:33,885
No, sorry.

346
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,892
Do you know, um, which direction he go?

347
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,186
I didn't notice.

348
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,936
Sorry.

349
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:44,979
Oh.

350
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,570
Was he here?

351
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,739
That's not... That's not
really what that's for...

352
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,209
Show me.

353
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,628
This is just about dry.

354
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,421
You're lucky the block didn't crack.

355
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:53,132
You see, it's leaking around the core. Hmm.

356
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:55,217
There's something lodged in here.

357
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,136
Looks like a slug.

358
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,641
Someone using your truck
for target practice?

359
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,519
Yeah, something like that.
Can you replace the radiator?

360
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:05,936
Yeah, sure.

361
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,564
Take a day or two to get the part.

362
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:09,524
We can't wait around that long.

363
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,109
I wouldn't drive it the way it
is. You could blow your engine.

364
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,780
I suppose I could probably
patch it temporarily

365
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,158
so that you could get where you are going.

366
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,367
Great.

367
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,952
- See you tomorrow.
- What?

368
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,540
It's after 6:00. We're closed.

369
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:29,918
Pima County Merchants Bank.

370
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:31,920
You may enter an extension at any time.

371
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,009
You've reached the
voicemail of Carl Neeham.

372
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,177
Please leave a message.

373
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,678
Yeah, Mr. Neeham...

374
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:43,725
Uh, Mr. Neeham, it's Jim Hanson here.

375
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,852
Listen, I was able to work something out.

376
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:48,438
Uh, if you can give me
just a few more days,

377
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:51,734
I can come in and make
things current on my loan.

378
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,319
Uh, thanks.

379
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,620
Okay. Double whiskey and a Coke.

380
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,622
You boys ready to order?

381
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,582
I'll have the steak. Rare.

382
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,792
And for the young man?

383
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,337
- Can I have a hamburger?
- Mmm-hmm.

384
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,590
Thank you.

385
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:16,090
Thanks.

386
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:19,969
Where'd you learn to speak English?

387
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:22,055
School.

388
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:25,850
Must have been a good student.

389
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,688
My mom, she made me study a lot.

390
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:33,567
Those men at the border,

391
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,236
you know why they were after you?

392
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,029
My Uncle Carlos.

393
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:41,450
He did something that made the cartel mad.

394
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,994
Called my mom and said we had to leave.

395
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:49,833
What about your dad?

396
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:52,461
He's dead.

397
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:53,671
Died before I was born.

398
00:45:58,092 --> 00:45:59,343
Your name is Miguel?

399
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:01,971
Yes.

400
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:03,514
Jim.

401
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,694
I need to go.

402
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,821
Huh?

403
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,783
Oh, yeah. Go on.

404
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:06,620
Jim.

405
00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:09,539
Jim.

406
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:19,382
Jackson.

407
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,593
Good boy.

408
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:13,186
Jackson?

409
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:29,287
Little shit!

410
00:48:42,216 --> 00:48:43,925
I'll do the shopping from here on.

411
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,314
Yeah, no guarantees on that, yeah?

412
00:48:56,355 --> 00:48:58,357
If I were you, I'd get
the whole thing replaced

413
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:00,817
when you get back home, wherever home is.

414
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:01,902
Yeah, will do.

415
00:49:01,944 --> 00:49:04,030
How old's your boy?

416
00:49:06,908 --> 00:49:08,409
He's not my kid.

417
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:35,269
You know how to read that thing?

418
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:45,404
We're, uh...

419
00:49:46,197 --> 00:49:47,533
We're around here someplace.

420
00:50:15,294 --> 00:50:16,044
Hello.

421
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:45,215
Can I help you?

422
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,330
Boss.

423
00:50:52,497 --> 00:50:53,248
Boss.

424
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:19,041
If you had a phone,

425
00:51:19,082 --> 00:51:20,668
we could have looked up the fastest way.

426
00:51:22,169 --> 00:51:23,295
So I hear.

427
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,800
Why do you not have one?
Is it because you're old?

428
00:51:28,343 --> 00:51:29,552
What?

429
00:51:29,594 --> 00:51:31,513
Some old people don't like phones.

430
00:51:32,555 --> 00:51:34,097
No, that's not it.

431
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:38,186
Nobody needs to call me,
and I like it that way.

432
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:46,319
Do you think I'll like it in Chicago?

433
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:49,197
Don't know why not.

434
00:51:51,031 --> 00:51:53,701
I spent some time there one
summer when I was about your age.

435
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:56,912
I remember...

436
00:51:57,539 --> 00:51:58,748
I remember how green it was.

437
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:01,334
Oh! And the hot dogs.

438
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:02,710
You like hot dogs?

439
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,588
You'll like these.

440
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,174
Chicago's famous for them.

441
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:10,426
No ketchup, though. Uh-uh.

442
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,805
Mustard, pickles, that sort of thing.

443
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:16,641
Never had one as good anywhere else.

444
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:34,951
What the hell?

445
00:53:00,352 --> 00:53:01,687
Stay calm and be quiet.

446
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,817
Your license, please.

447
00:53:11,447 --> 00:53:12,781
Looks like you had a little incident.

448
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,116
Yeah.

449
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,996
How are you there today, young man?

450
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:23,292
Okay.

451
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,587
Any weapons on you, sir?

452
00:53:26,629 --> 00:53:30,049
I've got a .45 under the
seat and a rifle in the back.

453
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,133
Both registered.

454
00:53:32,384 --> 00:53:33,885
Step out of the vehicle, please.

455
00:53:35,554 --> 00:53:37,014
I didn't think I was speeding.

456
00:53:37,056 --> 00:53:38,349
Is there a problem?

457
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,767
I just want to have a word with the boy.

458
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:41,310
It'll only take a minute.

459
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,863
Jackson, stay.

460
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:02,206
Walk back to my vehicle, please.

461
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:06,293
Go ahead and have a seat in the back.

462
00:54:36,491 --> 00:54:38,493
Conley, you out there?

463
00:54:41,538 --> 00:54:43,582
I got tired of waiting and ate without you.

464
00:55:02,184 --> 00:55:05,187
Go ahead and have a seat in your
truck while I run your information.

465
00:55:09,232 --> 00:55:11,693
Can I have my keys so I can run the A/C?

466
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:13,653
It'll only take a minute.

467
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:15,822
Jackson... Come on.

468
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:16,907
Come on.

469
00:55:16,948 --> 00:55:19,910
You, uh... You didn't talk to the boy.

470
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:22,705
What?

471
00:55:22,747 --> 00:55:25,499
You said you wanted a word with the
boy, but you didn't speak to him.

472
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,084
Get in the truck.

473
00:55:38,386 --> 00:55:39,429
How much?

474
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:40,972
Excuse me?

475
00:55:41,014 --> 00:55:43,726
How much are they paying
you to betray that badge?

476
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:45,185
Get in the truck.

477
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:46,853
You turn us over to them, they'll kill us.

478
00:55:47,354 --> 00:55:48,980
Get in the fucking truck!

479
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,643
Miguel, back in the truck! Now!

480
00:56:58,677 --> 00:56:59,720
Wait here.

481
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:21,575
What's up?

482
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:27,748
Stay down.

483
00:57:31,918 --> 00:57:32,960
Hey!

484
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:36,088
- I don't... What? I don't understand...
- Where is he?

485
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:37,591
- Where? Where? Where?
- I don't know!

486
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:48,352
Don't look.

487
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:15,362
Let's go.

488
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,070
Come on.

489
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,836
I'll be right back.

490
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:01,759
That'll be fine.

491
00:59:03,303 --> 00:59:06,889
If you're paying cash,
I can do 900 for both.

492
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,891
Ammo is on the house.

493
00:59:08,932 --> 00:59:10,809
- Sounds fair enough.
- Need some ID.

494
00:59:12,395 --> 00:59:14,522
Devil Dog, huh?

495
00:59:14,564 --> 00:59:15,939
'Nam?

496
00:59:15,981 --> 00:59:17,150
2 tours.

497
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:19,943
Hmm. I had a brother over there.

498
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:21,613
He didn't make it back.

499
00:59:23,114 --> 00:59:24,282
Sorry to hear that.

500
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:25,783
We lost some good men.

501
00:59:25,824 --> 00:59:27,410
We did.

502
00:59:27,452 --> 00:59:29,078
Got to run a background check.

503
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,789
Normally doesn't take too
long, but the computer's down.

504
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,584
Might be a few hours,
tomorrow at the latest.

505
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:36,794
I... I can't wait.

506
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:39,214
You see, I'm just passing through, and...

507
00:59:39,255 --> 00:59:43,092
I'm sorry, I can't risk losing my license.

508
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:48,097
Look, I'm no criminal,

509
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:51,226
but someone's after me,
and I need to watch my back.

510
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:52,686
The police can't help me.

511
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:54,938
I know it's asking a lot, but...

512
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:56,481
It's life or death.

513
00:59:58,566 --> 01:00:00,944
Something bad happens,

514
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:02,780
these end up in the wrong hands...

515
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:08,619
I'll report them stolen.

516
01:00:09,662 --> 01:00:11,789
I understand. Thanks.

517
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,251
This trouble you're in...

518
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:17,836
That your own doing?

519
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:19,547
Not exactly,

520
01:00:19,588 --> 01:00:23,883
but I made a choice, and
I got to live with it.

521
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,261
So long as it's for the right reasons.

522
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:34,811
Sarah, Jim's on the phone.

523
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:38,399
Listen, the DEA says

524
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,735
the man you saw at the
border is Mauricio Guerrero.

525
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:44,904
Recruited as a kid, soldiering
for the cartel ever since.

526
01:00:44,946 --> 01:00:47,408
And the man that you
shot? That was his brother.

527
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:50,286
Jeez.

528
01:00:50,327 --> 01:00:52,371
Mexican police have a source that said

529
01:00:52,413 --> 01:00:56,000
that kid's uncle stole money
from the Vasquez Cartel.

530
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,960
Found him hanging from an overpass.

531
01:00:58,918 --> 01:01:01,422
I don't know exactly what
you've got going on here,

532
01:01:01,463 --> 01:01:03,424
but it is not worth it.

533
01:01:03,883 --> 01:01:06,719
This Mauricio will find you,

534
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,679
and when he does,

535
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:11,807
he will kill you and that boy.

536
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,145
It's time to let this go.

537
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:26,864
Jim?

538
01:01:26,906 --> 01:01:28,700
Yeah, yeah, all right.

539
01:01:28,742 --> 01:01:30,159
I'll bring him in.

540
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:32,870
Where are you?

541
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:35,414
Uh, in the Texas Panhandle somewhere.

542
01:01:35,456 --> 01:01:37,709
A town called Weyburn.

543
01:01:37,751 --> 01:01:40,920
Okay, find the local sheriff's
office. They'll get you back here.

544
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:43,590
No, I can't trust them.

545
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:44,924
Fine.

546
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:47,427
Then I'll come myself.

547
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:49,011
Just...

548
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:51,055
Just stay off the streets,
and lay low till I get there.

549
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,973
Can you please do that for me?

550
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:54,183
Yeah.

551
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:00,940
What do you think?

552
01:02:02,234 --> 01:02:03,818
- Okay.
- Yeah?

553
01:02:15,705 --> 01:02:17,290
Here you go.

554
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:38,562
Why are we parking here?

555
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:41,898
I think it best we stay out of sight.

556
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,441
Come on, take your bag.

557
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,907
I'd like a room, please.

558
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:52,659
$39 plus tax.

559
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,745
Credit card and ID, please.

560
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,254
Will this do?

561
01:03:10,844 --> 01:03:12,929
Go on, get yourself cleaned up.

562
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:37,705
You're welcome.

563
01:03:40,957 --> 01:03:44,170
Um... Oh, I'll get some salt for the eggs.

564
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:45,588
Forget the salt.

565
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:52,094
Do you think they'll marry?

566
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,182
I don't know.

567
01:03:57,642 --> 01:03:59,435
I suppose they might.

568
01:04:00,894 --> 01:04:02,688
I have a girlfriend at home.

569
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,899
Someday, I'll marry her.

570
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:09,570
Do you have a wife?

571
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,197
Not anymore.

572
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:13,115
What happened?

573
01:04:13,908 --> 01:04:15,576
She died.

574
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,495
Cancer. Shitty disease.

575
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:24,043
They say you get used to
being alone after a while.

576
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,923
That's just crap.

577
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:33,637
You could get a girlfriend.

578
01:04:35,346 --> 01:04:37,890
I don't think so.

579
01:04:37,932 --> 01:04:39,726
I'm not young and handsome like you.

580
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:48,527
When we get to Chicago,

581
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:51,780
the first thing I want
to do is eat a hot dog.

582
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:01,205
Look, Miguel...

583
01:05:10,424 --> 01:05:13,468
It's late. Maybe you ought
to get some sleep, huh?

584
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,910
Want to go out, boy?

585
01:06:01,684 --> 01:06:04,436
Jackson. Jackson!

586
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,487
Miguel, wake up. We have to go.

587
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,497
911, what's your emergency?

588
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:25,040
There's a robbery in progress
here at the Blackwood Motel

589
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:26,292
on Route 12.

590
01:06:26,334 --> 01:06:28,210
There's at least 3 men with guns.

591
01:06:28,252 --> 01:06:30,672
3 men, sir?
Can you describe these men?

592
01:06:32,257 --> 01:06:33,591
Hello?

593
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:39,722
Go.

594
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:48,148
Hello, sir? Hello?

595
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:50,108
Sir, are you okay?

596
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:17,594
Marine Corps!

597
01:07:19,805 --> 01:07:22,015
You killed my brother!

598
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:28,396
You can't hide forever, Marine Corps!

599
01:07:53,922 --> 01:07:56,425
The truck is right through there.

600
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:59,428
Go get in it and wait for me.

601
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,472
- Okay?
- Where are you going?

602
01:08:01,513 --> 01:08:03,265
I got to get my dog.

603
01:08:03,307 --> 01:08:04,933
Go now. I'll be there in a minute.

604
01:08:16,027 --> 01:08:17,196
Jackson, no.

605
01:09:29,852 --> 01:09:31,896
He's in heaven now.

606
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:33,523
No such thing.

607
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:38,528
Just something people tell
you to make you feel better.

608
01:09:39,738 --> 01:09:42,990
My dog's nowhere but buried,
and that ain't where he belongs.

609
01:09:43,032 --> 01:09:46,536
You might as well get that heaven
crap out of your head right now.

610
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:47,621
You are wrong.

611
01:09:47,662 --> 01:09:49,331
The only thing I was wrong about

612
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:51,374
was driving your ass across the country.

613
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:53,376
I'm taking you back.

614
01:09:56,921 --> 01:09:58,715
I know about the money.

615
01:10:01,718 --> 01:10:03,720
I looked in the bag.

616
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:07,098
Get in the truck!

617
01:10:13,897 --> 01:10:14,898
Miguel!

618
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,070
Miguel!

619
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:44,344
911 got a call on a robbery in progress.

620
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,012
We showed up, the owner's neck was broken.

621
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,724
Still money in the drawer, though.

622
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:52,645
A guest says he saw a man and a
boy enter this room last night.

623
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:54,146
Seems they left here in a hurry.

624
01:10:54,896 --> 01:10:57,023
Maybe you can explain
what the hell is going on.

625
01:11:03,364 --> 01:11:04,906
Where are you, Jim?

626
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:37,231
Look, maybe I should have
said something about the money.

627
01:11:38,774 --> 01:11:41,152
It doesn't matter now, but...

628
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:43,154
I made a mistake thinking I could help you.

629
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:49,285
We're not going to Chicago?

630
01:12:22,944 --> 01:12:24,488
I'm sorry about Jackson.

631
01:12:25,822 --> 01:12:27,574
He was a great dog.

632
01:12:27,616 --> 01:12:29,826
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

633
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:34,748
Thanks, um, for helping
give him a proper burial.

634
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,836
I hope someday there's
a funeral for my mother.

635
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,123
Come on.

636
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:21,713
Excuse me, sir.

637
01:13:23,088 --> 01:13:24,089
Um...

638
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:27,092
I was wondering if you could help...

639
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:29,553
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord.

640
01:13:30,846 --> 01:13:34,057
May the perpetual light shine upon Rosa.

641
01:13:35,225 --> 01:13:37,770
And may her soul, through the mercy of God,

642
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:40,230
rest in peace.

643
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,651
Amen.

644
01:13:56,038 --> 01:13:57,164
Thanks.

645
01:13:57,915 --> 01:13:59,501
It's a lonely experience

646
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:01,461
to lose someone so close,

647
01:14:02,754 --> 01:14:04,129
especially for a child.

648
01:14:05,798 --> 01:14:07,717
He's your, what? Grandson?

649
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,720
No. Um, I knew his mother.

650
01:14:10,762 --> 01:14:13,013
She asked me to look after him.

651
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:15,475
That's no small request.

652
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:18,520
She must have had a lot of faith in you.

653
01:14:34,285 --> 01:14:35,286
Jim?

654
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:36,830
Yeah, it's me.

655
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:38,164
Tell me you're safe.

656
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:39,207
- We're okay.
- Is that him?

657
01:14:39,749 --> 01:14:40,917
Find out where he is.

658
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:43,002
Good. Now tell me exactly where you are.

659
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:44,295
- I got the sheriff with me.
- Sarah...

660
01:14:44,337 --> 01:14:46,422
I got plenty of firepower.
I just need to know...

661
01:14:46,464 --> 01:14:47,841
Sarah.

662
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:51,553
Listen, the kid's not going back.

663
01:14:51,594 --> 01:14:53,221
That's what I'm calling to tell you.

664
01:14:54,138 --> 01:14:55,641
I'm doing what his mother asked.

665
01:14:55,683 --> 01:14:57,392
I'm taking him to her family.

666
01:14:58,686 --> 01:15:00,436
That is not up to you.

667
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:03,273
And what kind of life's he
going to have back in Mexico?

668
01:15:03,314 --> 01:15:06,151
In protection forever,
if he even lasts a week?

669
01:15:06,192 --> 01:15:08,111
He can apply for asylum here.

670
01:15:08,153 --> 01:15:09,404
With what happened to his mother,

671
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:10,864
he'd have a strong case.

672
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:12,700
Can you guarantee he'll get it?

673
01:15:13,324 --> 01:15:15,368
Especially the way things are now?

674
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:20,416
Tell me what's going on with you here.

675
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,002
Let me help you while I still can.

676
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:27,631
This kid, he...

677
01:15:28,214 --> 01:15:30,008
He didn't bring any of this on himself.

678
01:15:30,049 --> 01:15:32,428
He just needs someone to give him a chance.

679
01:15:33,928 --> 01:15:35,514
I can't shake the feeling

680
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:39,518
that your mom is somehow
guiding me through this.

681
01:15:39,976 --> 01:15:41,853
She'd want me to help this kid.

682
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:46,567
If you do this, there's nothing
more I can do to help you.

683
01:15:48,068 --> 01:15:49,278
I know.

684
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,781
You do what you've got to do.

685
01:15:55,034 --> 01:15:56,285
We're heading to Chicago.

686
01:15:56,327 --> 01:15:58,412
Give me a few hours if you can.

687
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:02,124
See you around, Sarah.

688
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:08,881
So? What'd he say?

689
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:09,965
Where's he headed?

690
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,386
I don't know.

691
01:16:18,432 --> 01:16:21,477
the killer
of a highway patrol officer yesterday.

692
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:24,980
Officer Jay Conley was
found murdered along Highway 40,

693
01:16:25,022 --> 01:16:26,565
west of Amarillo.

694
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:28,150
Police say they have little to go on,

695
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:30,277
and are asking for the public's help.

696
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,988
Anyone who may have
witnessed anything suspicious

697
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:36,367
is asked to contact the
Texas authorities or the FBI.

698
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:37,868
In other news,

699
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,579
closing arguments are expected to begin...

700
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,467
I guess we'd better buy another map.

701
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:57,681
Figure out how to get you to Chicago.

702
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:25,233
Boss.

703
01:17:49,482 --> 01:17:50,567
Hello?

704
01:17:52,695 --> 01:17:53,862
Yeah.

705
01:17:56,948 --> 01:17:57,949
No problem.

706
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:12,632
Miguel, come here.

707
01:18:19,597 --> 01:18:20,847
Want to try?

708
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:23,476
Look, stand here.

709
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,312
Now, your finger here.

710
01:18:28,272 --> 01:18:29,273
There you go.

711
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,736
Now, line up this with this notch

712
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:36,863
with that can on the left.

713
01:18:37,698 --> 01:18:39,200
Spread your legs a little.

714
01:18:40,117 --> 01:18:42,911
Now, put your finger on the trigger.

715
01:18:44,037 --> 01:18:46,165
The gun's going to kick back hard,

716
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:47,916
so brace yourself.

717
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:53,172
And when you're ready, just squeeze.

718
01:18:55,299 --> 01:18:56,342
Try it again.

719
01:18:56,384 --> 01:18:58,469
Hold it steady, relax your shoulders.

720
01:18:58,844 --> 01:19:00,221
Keep them loose.

721
01:19:00,888 --> 01:19:02,598
Now, take a deep breath,

722
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:04,725
let half of it out...

723
01:19:05,393 --> 01:19:07,895
And squeeze that trigger.

724
01:19:13,777 --> 01:19:15,111
You're a natural.

725
01:19:17,905 --> 01:19:20,074
Press this button here
to remove the magazine.

726
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:23,077
Pull the slide back to clear it.

727
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:26,372
Now the gun's empty and safe.

728
01:19:37,133 --> 01:19:38,176
You were a soldier?

729
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:39,927
Yeah. Marine.

730
01:19:40,845 --> 01:19:42,764
- You fought in a war?
- Mmm-hmm.

731
01:19:44,974 --> 01:19:46,350
You killed other soldiers?

732
01:19:51,356 --> 01:19:54,275
Someday, I will kill those men.

733
01:19:56,695 --> 01:20:00,156
There's absolutely nothing that
feels good about killing another man.

734
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:05,412
Your mother died to give you
a chance at a better life.

735
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:08,332
Don't waste it.

736
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:15,631
This is the spot.

737
01:20:56,714 --> 01:20:59,341
Do you still get sad when
you think about your wife?

738
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:03,470
I miss that woman every day.

739
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:08,183
Life doesn't always play
out the way you expect.

740
01:21:11,019 --> 01:21:12,980
There are good times ahead for you, Miguel.

741
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:16,484
Your mom's watching over.

742
01:21:17,443 --> 01:21:18,902
She'll make sure of that.

743
01:21:28,288 --> 01:21:29,622
This belongs to you.

744
01:21:34,627 --> 01:21:35,753
I don't want it.

745
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,631
It's cartel's money.

746
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:49,392
Then I guess we've got no use for this.

747
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:41,110
You know something?

748
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:43,112
It's not bad.

749
01:22:48,452 --> 01:22:49,537
Ready?

750
01:23:51,432 --> 01:23:52,558
Where are we going?

751
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:55,895
Let's take some side roads for a while.

752
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:03,511
Hello.

753
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:07,699
Exit 209?

754
01:24:08,742 --> 01:24:09,784
You sure?

755
01:24:10,142 --> 01:24:11,102
OK, thank you.

756
01:24:46,363 --> 01:24:47,781
Is that him?

757
01:24:47,822 --> 01:24:48,948
Hold on tight.

758
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:13,181
Shit!

759
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,881
Get out.

760
01:25:55,641 --> 01:25:57,142
We should run. He'll kill us.

761
01:25:58,018 --> 01:25:59,729
Not if I get him first.

762
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:02,584
Miguel, let's go.

763
01:27:02,626 --> 01:27:03,794
Come on.

764
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,201
Boss, boss.

765
01:27:45,169 --> 01:27:46,170
Come on.

766
01:28:00,559 --> 01:28:02,186
Stay down. Here.

767
01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:06,857
If anything happens to me,

768
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:10,068
you get out of here, and you
run as far away as you can.

769
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:11,528
Understand?

770
01:29:01,287 --> 01:29:02,789
Miguel, come over here.

771
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,877
I need you to create a distraction.

772
01:29:08,919 --> 01:29:13,424
Count to 30, then fire
2 quick shots out there.

773
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:14,759
It's ready.

774
01:29:16,636 --> 01:29:18,388
Start counting. Now.

775
01:29:44,147 --> 01:29:46,274
10, 11...

776
01:29:50,570 --> 01:29:52,698
14, 15...

777
01:30:12,801 --> 01:30:15,471
28, 29...

778
01:31:21,011 --> 01:31:22,054
Miguel?

779
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:45,787
Marine Corps!

780
01:31:48,456 --> 01:31:50,124
Get in here and let's finish this!

781
01:31:56,673 --> 01:31:58,341
Drop your gun!

782
01:32:05,223 --> 01:32:06,266
Drop it!

783
01:32:15,483 --> 01:32:17,943
Let him go, you bastard.

784
01:32:18,236 --> 01:32:20,447
Let him go?

785
01:32:20,488 --> 01:32:21,864
Why?

786
01:32:25,911 --> 01:32:27,828
He's going to make a good soldier one day.

787
01:32:29,372 --> 01:32:30,999
He's going to be trained by the best.

788
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:33,877
He will never kill for you.

789
01:32:35,545 --> 01:32:36,546
No?

790
01:32:38,924 --> 01:32:40,091
You know, I was...

791
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:43,094
I was just like him one day.

792
01:32:45,055 --> 01:32:47,974
We all learn to do what
we must do to survive.

793
01:32:48,809 --> 01:32:50,435
Just like you and me, soldier.

794
01:32:51,311 --> 01:32:52,688
We made our choices.

795
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:54,272
Let him make his.

796
01:32:56,316 --> 01:32:58,819
Do you think I had a choice?

797
01:32:58,860 --> 01:32:59,861
Huh?

798
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:02,698
I never had a choice!

799
01:33:04,449 --> 01:33:05,450
Miguel.

800
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:12,667
Now he's going to kill his first man today.

801
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:14,167
- Same as...
- Miguel.

802
01:33:14,209 --> 01:33:15,419
Look at me.

803
01:33:59,463 --> 01:34:00,882
Yeah!

804
01:34:49,914 --> 01:34:50,915
Shoot!

805
01:34:54,185 --> 01:34:56,020
Miguel, don't listen to him.

806
01:34:56,688 --> 01:34:57,630
Don't do it.

807
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:01,818
Give me the gun.

808
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:03,027
Give me the gun.

809
01:35:03,428 --> 01:35:04,263
Kill me.

810
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,297
Miguel, walk away.

811
01:35:23,966 --> 01:35:25,676
Walk away. Now.

812
01:35:35,519 --> 01:35:36,728
Wait.

813
01:36:38,957 --> 01:36:41,169
Now you have a choice.

814
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:38,830
This is for you.

815
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,040
Miguel!

816
01:39:25,652 --> 01:39:28,321
Thank God you're OK, son.

817
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:31,908
Come here.

818
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,536
Come here.

819
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:35,953
Everyone come here!

820
01:39:36,204 --> 01:39:37,414
It's Miguel.
