We have zero tolerance
for cell phones in class,

178

so we will get
to know each other
in detention. Cell phone.

180
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,320
Mr. Bolton,
I see your phone is involved.

181
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
So we will see you
in detention as well.

182
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,480
That's not a possibility,
Miss Darbus.

Ah, that will be 15 minutes
for you, too, Mr. Danforth.
Count 'em.

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,080

He can't count that high.

Well, me...
Either. But how?

200
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,680
My mom's company
transferred her
here to Albuquerque.

201
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,120
I can't believe you live here.

202
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,920
I looked for you at the lodge
on New Year's Day.

We had to leave first thing.

204

Why are you whispering?

205
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,280
What? Oh, uh... My friends
know about the snowboarding.

206
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,520
I haven't quite told them
about the singing thing.

207
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
What's up?
Hey.

208
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,120
Too much for them to handle?

209
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
No, it was cool.

210
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,600
But, you know,
my friends, it's, uh...
It's not what I do.

211

That was, like,
a different person.

met Miss Darbus.

I bet you just can't wait
to sign up for that.

215
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,080
I won't be signing up
for anything for a while.

216
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,840
I just wanna get
to know the school.

217
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,760
But if you sign up,
I'd consider
coming to the show.

218
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,920
Yeah, yeah.
That's completely impossible.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,880
What's impossible, Troy?

220
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,160
I wouldn't think "impossible"
is even in your vocabulary.

221
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,520
Oh, so nice of you to
show our new classmate around.

222
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Oh, were you
going to sign up, too?

223
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,680
My brother and I
have starred in all
the school's productions

welcome newcomers.

There are a lot of
supporting roles.

226
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm sure we could find
something for you.

227
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,760
No, no, no.
I was just looking at
all the bulletin boards.

228
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,120
Lots going on at this school.
Wow.

229
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,240
Nice penmanship.

230
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,240
So, Troy,
I missed you during vacation.
What'd you do?

231
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,880
You know,
um, played basketball,
snowboarding, more basketball.

232
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
When's the big game?

233
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
Two weeks.

234
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,200
You are so dedicated.
Just like me.

235
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,560
I hope you come watch me
in the musical. Promise?

that school musical thing?

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,000
You get extra credit
just for auditioning?

240
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,760
Who cares?
It's always good
to get extra credit

241
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
for college.

242
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,440

or Shaquille O'Neal

243

auditioned for
their school musical?

244
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Maybe.
Troy.

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,320

isn't hip-hop or rock,

or anything
essential to culture.

247
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,280
It's, like, show music.
It's all costumes and makeup.

I know. I thought
it'd be a good laugh.

Not really.
He was just showing me around.

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,040
Well, Troy usually doesn't
interact with new students.

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,840
Uh, why not?

320
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,640
It's pretty much basketball

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,280

about an audition?

1031
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,240
BOYS: We are.

1032
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,440
Guys, come on.

1033
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,440
There's 12 people on
this team, not just me.

1034
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,160
Just 12? Oh, no.

1035
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,240
I think you're
forgetting about one very

1036
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,360
important 13th
member of our squad.

1037
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,560
My dad.

1038
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,800
Yes, Troy.

1039
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,920
Wildcat basketball champion,
class of 1981.

1040
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,640
Champion, father,
and now coach.

1041
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,360
It's a winning
tradition like no other.

1042
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,560
From lowly Neanderthal
and Cro-Magnon,

1043
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,840
to early warriors,
medieval knights.

1044
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,200
All leading up to

1045
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,320
lunkhead basketball man.

1046
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,400
Yes, our culture worshiped the
aggressor throughout the ages

1047
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,480
and we end up with spoiled,
overpaid bonehead athletes

1048
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,000
who contribute little
to civilization

1049
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,480
other than slam dunks
and touchdowns.

1050
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,680
That is the inevitable world
of Troy Bolton.

1051
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,520
But the path of the mind,
the path we're on,

1052
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,720
ours is the path that
has brought us these people:

1053
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,640
Eleanor Roosevelt,
Frida Kahlo.
Sandra Day O'Connor,

1054
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,920
Madame Curie, Jane Goodall,
Oprah Winfrey

1055
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,040
and so many others
who the world reveres.

1056
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,240
Uh, but, what is...

1057
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,120
I've got Kelsi waiting
for me to rehearse.

1058
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,640
Gabriella!

1059
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,200
Troy Bolton
represents one side
of evolution.

1060
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,120
And our side,
the side of education
and accomplishment,

1061
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,400
is the future of civilization!

1062
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,120
This is the side
where you belong.

1063
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,160
Guys, if you don't
know that I'll put

1064
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,200
a 110% of my guts
into that game,

1065
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,480
then you don't know me.

1066
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,800
But we just thought...

1067
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,160
I'll tell you what I thought.

1068
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,040
I thought that
you're my friends.

1069
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,680
Win together,
lose together, team-mates.

1070
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,240
But suddenly the girl...
And the singing.

1071
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,920
Man, I'm for the team!

1072
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,800

(COMPUTER BEEPS)

1074
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,160
All right,
the singing thing is nothing.

1075
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,760
A way to keep my nerves down.

1076
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,800
It means nothing to me.
You're my guys and
this is our team.

Gabriella is not important.

1078
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,280
I'll forget about her,
forget the audition

1079
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,920
and we'll get
that championship.

1080

get Troy to say things

forget about the callbacks.

Troy to say anything.
