1
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,925
Call: received

2
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:52,595
- Is everything in place?
- You're not to relieve me.

3
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,473
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

4
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,392
You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.

5
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:01,646
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're going to kill him.

6
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,357
Morpheus believes he is the One.

7
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,566
Do you?

8
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,568
It doesn't matter what I believe.

9
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,445
You don't, do you?

10
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,781
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

11
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,616
Are you sure this line is clean?

12
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,868
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

13
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,662
I better go.

14
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,410
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

15
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,036
Do it! Do it now!

16
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:23,060
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

17
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,106
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.

18
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,066
I'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:34,113
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion" crap,
you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,074
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,786
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,668
I sent two units!

23
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,503
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,882
No, lieutenant, your men are already dead.

25
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,037
Shit.

26
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,042
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

27
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,919
I know. They cut the hard line.

28
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,296
There's no time.
Get to another exit.

29
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,965
- Are there any agents?
- Yes.

30
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,342
Goddamn it.

31
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,135
You have to focus, Trinity.

32
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,763
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.

33
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,807
You can make it.

34
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,725
- All right.
- Go.

35
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,913
That's impossible.

36
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,909
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

37
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,785
Get up.

38
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,166
She got out.

39
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,751
It doesn't matter.

40
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,171
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

41
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,090
We have the name of their next target.

42
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,008
The name is Neo.

43
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,805
We'll need a search running.

44
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,015
It has already begun.

45
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,988
What?

46
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,245
What the hell?

47
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,838
"Follow the white rabbit."

48
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,851
Who is it?

49
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,394
It's Choi.

50
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,360
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,076
You're two hours late.

52
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,411
I know. It's her fault.

53
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,663
You got the money?

54
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,957
Two grand.

55
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,959
Hold on.

56
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,020
Hallelujah.

57
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,148
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

58
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,275
You get caught using that...

59
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,653
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

60
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,864
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

61
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,158
You look a little whiter than usual.

62
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,453
My computer, it...

63
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:04,002
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

64
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,548
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

65
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,175
It's the only way to fly.

66
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,554
It just sounds like you need to unplug.

67
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,306
Get some R and R?

68
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,477
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

69
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,689
Definitely.

70
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,025
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

71
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,777
Come on.

72
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,655
It'll be fun. I promise.

73
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,663
Yeah.

74
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,332
Sure. I'll go.

75
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,028
Hello, Neo.

76
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,530
How do you know that name?

77
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,074
I know a lot about you.

78
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,036
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

79
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,205
Trinity.

80
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,999
The Trinity?

81
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,168
That cracked the IRS D-base?

82
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,878
That was a long time ago.

83
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,047
- Jesus.
- What?

84
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,299
I just thought...

85
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,219
...you were a guy.

86
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,929
Most guys do.

87
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,349
That was you on my computer.

88
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,059
How did you do that?

89
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,437
Right now, all I can tell you...

90
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,606
...is that you're in danger.

91
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,484
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

92
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,736
They're watching you, Neo.

93
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,739
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

94
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,078
I know why you're here, Neo.

95
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,831
I know what you've been doing.

96
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,958
I know why you hardly sleep...

97
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,378
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

98
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,964
...you sit at your computer.

99
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,675
You're looking for him.

100
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,470
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

101
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,098
And when he found me...

102
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,810
...he told me I wasn't
really looking for him...

103
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,479
...I was looking for an answer.

104
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,233
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

105
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,570
It's the question that brought you here.

106
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,031
You know the question...

107
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,783
...just as I did.

108
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,953
What is the Matrix?

109
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,664
The answer is out there, Neo.

110
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,333
It's looking for you.

111
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,794
And it will find you...

112
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,088
...if you want it to.

113
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,846
Shit.

114
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,222
Shit, shit.

115
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,319
You have a problem
with authority, Mr. Anderson.

116
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,615
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

117
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,326
Obviously, you are mistaken.

118
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,165
This is one of the top software
companies in the world...

119
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,793
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

120
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:36,673
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

121
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,137
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

122
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,892
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

123
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,103
...or you choose to find another job.

124
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,314
Do I make myself clear?

125
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,983
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

126
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,326
Thomas Anderson?

127
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,996
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,998
Okay.

129
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,172
Great.

130
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,758
Have a nice day.

131
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,274
Hello?

132
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,903
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

133
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,907
- Morpheus.
- Yes.

134
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,159
I've been looking for you.

135
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,579
I don't know if you're ready
to see what I want to show you.

136
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,000
But unfortunately, you
and I have run out of time.

137
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,962
They're coming for you, and I don't
know what they're going to do.

138
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,547
Who's coming for me?

139
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,882
Stand up and see for yourself.

140
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,634
What? Right now?

141
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,429
Yes. Now.

142
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,181
Do it slowly.

143
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,808
The elevator.

144
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,481
- Oh, shit!
- Yes.

145
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,237
What do they want?

146
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,741
I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.

147
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,950
How?

148
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,328
I can guide you, but you
must do exactly as I say.

149
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,206
- Okay.
- The cubicle across from you is empty.

150
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,462
- But what if they...
- Go. Now.

151
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,596
Stay here for just a moment.

152
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,564
When I tell you, go to the end of the row...

153
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,775
...to the office at the end of the hall.

154
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,402
Stay as low as you can.

155
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,822
Go. Now.

156
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:23,757
Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.

157
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,804
- How do you know this?
- We don't have time.

158
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,890
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.

159
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,685
Open it.

160
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,313
Take the scaffold to the roof.

161
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,149
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

162
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,777
There are two ways out of this building.

163
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,823
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.

164
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,284
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.

165
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,623
This is insane!

166
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,668
Why is this happening to me?

167
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,586
What'd I do?

168
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,714
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

169
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,758
I'm gonna die.

170
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,602
Shit!

171
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:38,999
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,755
I can't do this.

173
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,436
Shit.

174
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:53,531
As you can see, we've had our eye on you
for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

175
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,494
It seems that you've been living...

176
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,871
...two lives.

177
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,792
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson...

178
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,379
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

179
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,716
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

180
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,426
And you...

181
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,640
...help your landlady carry out her garbage.

182
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,271
The other life is lived in computers...

183
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,524
...where you go by the hacker alias "Neo"...

184
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:32,570
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

185
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,824
One of these lives...

186
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,909
...has a future.

187
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,245
And one of them does not.

188
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,794
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

189
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,130
You're here...

190
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,716
...because we need your help.

191
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,347
We know that you've been
contacted by a certain...

192
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,391
...individual.

193
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:06,354
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

194
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,359
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

195
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,029
He is considered by many authorities...

196
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,324
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

197
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,244
My colleagues...

198
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,622
...believe that I am
wasting my time with you.

199
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,335
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

200
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,130
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

201
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,632
...give you a fresh start.

202
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,053
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

203
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,806
...in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

204
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,434
Yeah.

205
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,812
That sounds like a really good deal.

206
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,191
But I got a better one.

207
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,942
How about...

208
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,362
...I give you the finger...

209
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,949
...and you give me my phone call.

210
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,995
Mr. Anderson...

211
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,209
...you disappoint me.

212
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,087
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

213
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,713
I know my rights.

214
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,465
I want my phone call.

215
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,218
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

216
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,512
...what good is a phone call...

217
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:24,349
...if you're unable to speak?

218
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,343
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson...

219
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,012
...whether you want to or not.

220
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,699
This line is tapped, so I must be brief.

221
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,245
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.

222
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,331
If they knew what I know...

223
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,583
...you would probably be dead.

224
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,296
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

225
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:23,384
You are the One, Neo.
You may have spent the last few years...

226
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:26,596
...looking for me,
but I've spent my entire life...

227
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,348
...looking for you.

228
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,060
Now, do you still want to meet?

229
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,897
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

230
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,325
Get in.

231
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,421
What's this?

232
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,216
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

233
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,635
- From what?
- From you.

234
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,638
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

235
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,973
Stop the car.

236
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,728
Listen, coppertop.

237
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,981
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

238
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,858
Right now, there's only one rule:

239
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,485
Our way...

240
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,903
...or the highway.

241
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,536
Fine.

242
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,873
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

243
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,085
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

244
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,045
You know that road.

245
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,673
You know exactly where it ends.

246
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,136
And I know that's not where you want to be.

247
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,860
Apoc, lights.

248
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,531
Lie back. Lift up your shirt.

249
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,702
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

250
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,919
Try and relax.

251
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,385
Come on.

252
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,471
Come on.

253
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,223
It's on the move.

254
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,226
Come on, you shit.

255
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,314
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

256
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,565
Clear!

257
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,284
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

258
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,361
This is it.

259
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,158
Let me give you one piece of advice.

260
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,786
Be honest.

261
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,581
He knows more than you can imagine.

262
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,633
At last.

263
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,261
Welcome, Neo.

264
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,389
As you no doubt have guessed...

265
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,890
...I am Morpheus.

266
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,518
It's an honor to meet you.

267
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,019
No...

268
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,896
...the honor is mine.

269
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,316
Please, come. Sit.

270
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,041
I imagine...

271
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,211
...that right now you're
feeling a bit like Alice...

272
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,340
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

273
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,259
You could say that.

274
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,804
I can see it in your eyes.

275
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:40,683
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

276
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,186
...because he's expecting to wake up.

277
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,190
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

278
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,276
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

279
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,527
No.

280
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,987
Why not?

281
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,032
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

282
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,453
I know exactly what you mean.

283
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,126
Let me tell you why you're here.

284
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,712
You know something.

285
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,881
What you know, you can't explain.

286
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,966
But you feel it.

287
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,469
You felt it your entire life:

288
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,224
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

289
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,935
Like a splinter in your mind...

290
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,062
...driving you mad.

291
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,732
It is this feeling that has
brought you to me.

292
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,111
Do you know what I'm talking about?

293
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,281
The Matrix?

294
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,452
Do you want to know...

295
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,913
...what it is?

296
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,167
The Matrix is everywhere.

297
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,127
It is all around us.

298
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,338
Even now, in this very room.

299
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,383
You can see it when you
look out your window...

300
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,969
...or when you turn on your television.

301
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,930
You can feel it when you go to work...

302
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,141
...when you go to church...

303
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,644
...when you pay your taxes.

304
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,690
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

305
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,525
...to blind you from the truth.

306
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,987
What truth?

307
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,784
That you are a slave.

308
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,580
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

309
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,501
...born into a prison that you
cannot smell or taste or touch.

310
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,086
A prison...

311
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,462
...for your mind.

312
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,805
Unfortunately, no one can be...

313
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,516
...told what the Matrix is.

314
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,855
You have to see it for yourself.

315
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,658
This is your last chance.

316
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,244
After this, there is no turning back.

317
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,163
You take the blue pill...

318
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,541
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

319
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,585
...whatever you want to believe.

320
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,170
You take the red pill...

321
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,380
...you stay in Wonderland...

322
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,592
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

323
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,686
Remember...

324
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,565
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

325
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,206
Follow me.

326
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,418
Apoc, are we on-line?

327
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,045
Almost.

328
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,425
Time is always against us.

329
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,302
Please take a seat there.

330
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,197
- You did all this?
- Mm-hm.

331
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,328
The pill you took is part
of a trace program.

332
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,709
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

333
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,293
What does that mean?

334
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,046
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy...

335
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,715
...because Kansas...

336
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,008
...is going bye-bye.

337
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,297
Did you...?

338
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,395
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

339
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,441
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

340
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,194
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

341
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,237
...and the real world?

342
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,032
This can't be.

343
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,241
Be what?

344
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,452
Be real?

345
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,832
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

346
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,042
Still nothing.

347
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,835
It's cold.

348
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,462
It's cold!

349
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,009
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

350
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,180
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

351
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,890
Targeting almost there.

352
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,603
He's going into arrest.

353
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,356
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

354
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,701
Welcome...

355
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,953
...to the real world.

356
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,206
We've done it, Trinity.

357
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,000
We found him.

358
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,044
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

359
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,213
I know it.

360
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,428
Am I dead?

361
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,097
Far from it.

362
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,487
He still needs a lot of work.

363
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,115
What are you doing?

364
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,576
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

365
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,703
Why do my eyes hurt?

366
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,289
You've never used them before.

367
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,085
Rest, Neo.

368
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,004
The answers are coming.

369
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,163
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

370
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,873
What is this place?

371
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,793
More important than "what" is "when."

372
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,336
"When"?

373
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,588
You believe it's the year 1999...

374
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,091
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

375
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,970
I can't tell you exactly what year it is...

376
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,847
...because we honestly don't know.

377
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,183
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

378
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:51,186
Come with me.
See for yourself.

379
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,480
This is my ship.

380
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,692
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

381
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,280
This is the main deck.

382
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,287
This is the core...

383
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,543
...where we broadcast our pirate
signal and hack into the Matrix.

384
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,091
Most of my crew you already know.

385
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,514
This is Apoc...

386
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,641
...Switch...

387
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,394
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

388
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,356
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

389
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,651
The little one behind you is Mouse.

390
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,242
You wanted to know what the Matrix is?

391
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,495
Trinity.

392
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,100
Try to relax.

393
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,815
This will feel a little weird.

394
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,162
This...

395
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,039
...is the Construct.

396
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,583
It's our loading program.

397
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,294
We can load anything, from clothing...

398
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,921
...to equipment...

399
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,548
...weapons...

400
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,008
...training simulations...

401
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,928
...anything we need.

402
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,141
Right now we're inside a computer program?

403
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,352
Is it really so hard to believe?

404
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,480
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

405
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,775
Your hair has changed.

406
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,487
Your appearance now is what
we call "residual self-image."

407
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,824
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

408
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:15,831
This isn't real?

409
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,624
What is "real"?

410
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,252
How do you define "real"?

411
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,462
If you're talking about what you can feel...

412
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,132
...what you can smell, taste and see...

413
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:29,261
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

414
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,851
This is the world that you know.

415
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,314
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

416
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:47,029
It exists now only as part
of a neural-interactive simulation...

417
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,530
...that we call the Matrix.

418
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,871
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.

419
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,998
This is the world...

420
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,042
...as it exists today.

421
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,058
Welcome to "the desert...

422
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,518
...of the real."

423
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,274
We have only bits and pieces of information.

424
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,320
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

425
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,823
...all of mankind was united in celebration.

426
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:36,828
We marveled at our own
magnificence as we gave birth to Al.

427
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,747
Al.

428
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,166
You mean artificial intelligence.

429
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,837
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

430
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:50,133
We don't know who struck first, us or them.

431
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,762
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

432
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,599
They were dependent on solar power...

433
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,186
...and it was believed that they
would be unable to survive...

434
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,023
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

435
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:10,153
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

436
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,826
Fate, it seems,
is not without a sense of irony.

437
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:23,458
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

438
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,838
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

439
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,925
Combined with a form of fusion...

440
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:37,097
...the machines had found
all the energy they would ever need.

441
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:44,896
There are fields, Neo, endless fields...

442
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:48,400
...where human beings are no longer born.

443
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,944
We are grown.

444
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,578
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.

445
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,497
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

446
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,459
...watched them liquefy the dead...

447
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,045
...so they could be fed
intravenously to the living.

448
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:13,842
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

449
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,012
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

450
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,433
What is the Matrix?

451
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,685
Control.

452
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,440
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

453
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,319
...built to keep us under control...

454
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,656
...in order to change a human being...

455
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,450
...into this.

456
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,952
No.

457
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,164
I don't believe it.

458
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,749
It's not possible.

459
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:50,921
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

460
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,464
Stop!

461
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,216
Let me out!

462
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:56,843
Let me out! I want out!

463
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,473
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

464
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,391
Get this thing out of me!

465
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,686
Don't touch me!

466
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:08,563
Stay away from me!

467
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,482
I don't believe it.

468
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,400
I don't believe it.

469
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,152
I don't believe it.

470
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,446
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

471
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:17,906
Just breathe.

472
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,093
I can't go back, can I?

473
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,345
No.

474
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,389
But if you could...

475
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,724
...would you really want to?

476
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,603
I owe you an apology.

477
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,564
We have a rule.

478
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,276
We never free a mind once
it's reached a certain age.

479
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,527
It's dangerous.

480
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,946
The mind has trouble letting go.

481
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,490
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

482
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,618
I did what I did because...

483
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,787
...I had to.

484
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:18,300
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

485
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,596
...who had the ability to change
whatever he wanted...

486
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,891
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

487
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,104
It was he who freed the first of us...

488
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,607
...taught us the truth.

489
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,153
As long as the Matrix exists...

490
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,572
...the human race will never be free.

491
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,328
After he died...

492
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,789
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

493
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,543
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

494
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,462
...end the war...

495
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,047
...bring freedom to our people.

496
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:03,011
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

497
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:04,930
...looking for him.

498
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,434
I did what I did because...

499
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,188
...I believe that search is over.

500
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,694
Get some rest.

501
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,113
You're going to need it.

502
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,867
For what?

503
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,121
Your training.

504
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,141
Morning. Did you sleep?

505
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,227
You will tonight.

506
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,145
I guarantee it.

507
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,565
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

508
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,443
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

509
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:06,074
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

510
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,534
Born free right here...

511
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,411
...in the real world.

512
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,329
Genuine child of Zion.

513
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,624
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

514
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,376
...Zion's where the party would be.

515
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,086
It's a city?

516
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,506
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

517
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,342
Where is it?

518
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:29,514
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

519
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,018
You live long enough, you might see it.

520
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:40,108
Goddamn! I gotta tell you,
I'm excited to see what you're capable of...

521
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,110
...if Morpheus is right and all.

522
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,363
We're not supposed to talk
about this, but...

523
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,032
...if you are...

524
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:50,118
...it's a very exciting time.

525
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,872
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

526
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,712
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

527
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:05,175
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

528
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,968
How about...

529
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,305
...combat training?

530
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,812
"Jujitsu"?

531
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,356
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

532
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,911
Holy shit!

533
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,497
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

534
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,123
How about some more?

535
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,666
Hell, yes.

536
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:41,795
Hell, yeah.

537
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,058
How is he?

538
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,477
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

539
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,073
I know kung fu.

540
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,742
Show me.

541
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,287
This is a sparring program...

542
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,332
...similar to the programmed
reality of the Matrix.

543
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,918
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

544
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,630
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

545
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,674
Some of them can be bent.

546
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,343
Others can be broken.

547
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,970
Understand?

548
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,097
Then hit me...

549
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,807
...if you can.

550
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:15,847
Good!

551
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:17,765
Adaptation.

552
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,267
Improvisation.

553
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,894
But your weakness...

554
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,520
...is not your technique.

555
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,571
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

556
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,019
How did I beat you?

557
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,694
You're too fast.

558
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,570
Do you believe that...

559
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,448
...my being stronger or faster...

560
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:01,369
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

561
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:07,208
You think you're breathing air?

562
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:21,931
Again!

563
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,820
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

564
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,281
His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.

565
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,204
What are you waiting for?

566
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,415
You're faster than this.

567
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,836
Don't think you are.

568
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,755
Know you are.

569
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,934
Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!

570
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,613
I don't believe it.

571
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,283
I know what you're trying to do.

572
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,120
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

573
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,539
But I can only show you the door.

574
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,958
You have to walk through it.

575
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,463
Tank, load the jump program.

576
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,769
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

577
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,480
...doubt and disbelief.

578
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,359
Free your mind.

579
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,743
Whoa.

580
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,252
Okey-dokey.

581
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,505
Free my mind.

582
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,090
What if he makes it?

583
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,051
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

584
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,847
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

585
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,515
Come on.

586
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,933
All right.

587
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,436
No problem. Free my mind.

588
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,022
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

589
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,085
What does that mean?

590
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,296
It doesn't mean anything.

591
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,466
Everybody falls the first time.

592
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,217
Right, Trin?

593
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,532
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

594
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,038
If you're killed in the Matrix...

595
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:33,247
...you die here?

596
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:36,334
The body cannot live without the mind.

597
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:10,201
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

598
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,123
There is something about him, isn't there?

599
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,376
You're a believer now?

600
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,586
I keep wondering...

601
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:24,507
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

602
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,344
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

603
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,689
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

604
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,733
That system is our enemy.

605
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,695
But when you're inside, what do you see?

606
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:49,740
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.

607
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,785
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

608
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,997
But until we do, these people
are a part of that system...

609
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,165
...and that makes them our enemy.

610
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,542
You have to understand...

611
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,129
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

612
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:04,964
And many of them are so inert...

613
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,633
...so hopelessly dependent on the system...

614
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,595
...that they will fight to protect it.

615
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,850
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

616
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:17,768
- I was...
- Look again.

617
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,104
Freeze it.

618
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,362
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

619
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,993
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

620
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,038
if you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

621
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,374
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

622
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:45,421
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

623
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,175
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

624
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:50,843
...is potentially an agent.

625
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,638
Inside the Matrix...

626
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,931
...they are everyone...

627
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,975
...and they are no one.

628
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:01,354
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

629
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,230
...but they are the gatekeepers.

630
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,442
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

631
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,528
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

632
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,905
Someone?

633
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,657
I won't lie to you, Neo.

634
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:17,953
Every single man or woman who has
fought an agent, has died.

635
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:20,581
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

636
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,832
Why?

637
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,377
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

638
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:28,214
Men have emptied entire clips
at them and hit nothing but air.

639
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:33,094
Yet their strength and speed are
still based in a world built on rules.

640
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,470
Because of that...

641
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,099
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

642
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,271
What are you telling me?

643
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,440
That I can dodge bullets?

644
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,819
No, Neo.

645
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,239
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

646
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,449
...you won't have to.

647
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,788
We got trouble.

648
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,184
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

649
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:26,731
Shit.

650
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,859
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

651
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,279
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

652
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:34,739
Search and destroy.

653
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,241
Set her down there.

654
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,014
How are we doing, Tank?

655
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:09,899
Power off-line.

656
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,359
EMP armed...

657
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:14,445
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

658
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,614
Electromagnetic pulse.

659
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,742
Disables any electrical
system in the blast radius.

660
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:22,203
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

661
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,128
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

662
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,506
Sewers.

663
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,425
There used to be cities that
spanned hundreds of miles.

664
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:38,844
Now these sewers are all that's left.

665
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,429
Quiet.

666
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,471
Whoa! Neo.

667
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,475
You scared the bejesus out of me.

668
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,478
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

669
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:33,232
Is that...?

670
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,067
The Matrix?

671
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,443
Yeah.

672
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:41,407
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

673
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:44,743
The image translators work
for the construct program.

674
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:48,414
But there's way too much
information to decode the Matrix.

675
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,625
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

676
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:55,296
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

677
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,840
Do you...

678
01:01:58,132 --> 01:01:59,216
...want a drink?

679
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,509
Sure.

680
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,514
You know...

681
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,975
...I know what you're thinking.

682
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,311
Because right now I'm
thinking the same thing.

683
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,981
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

684
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,903
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?

685
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,208
Good shit, huh?

686
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,752
Dozer makes it.

687
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,378
It's good for two things:

688
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:39,715
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

689
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,927
So can I ask you something?

690
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,556
Did he tell you why he did it?

691
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,019
Why you're here?

692
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,441
Jesus!

693
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,569
What a mind job.

694
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,782
So you're here to save the world.

695
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,369
What do you say to something like that?

696
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,917
A little piece of advice.

697
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,128
You see an agent...

698
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,756
...you do what we do:

699
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,633
Run.

700
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,718
You run your ass off.

701
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,686
Thanks for the drink.

702
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:39,566
Sweet dreams.

703
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,991
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

704
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:48,784
You know...

705
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,663
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

706
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:56,417
I know that when I put it in my mouth...

707
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,753
...the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...

708
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,171
...juicy...

709
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,173
...and delicious.

710
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:07,344
After nine years...

711
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,930
...you know what I realize?

712
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:18,981
Ignorance is bliss.

713
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,863
Then we have a deal.

714
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,284
I don't want to remember nothing.

715
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,037
Nothing. You understand?

716
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,917
And I want to be rich.

717
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:42,963
You know, someone important.

718
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,591
Like an actor.

719
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,928
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

720
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,640
Okay.

721
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,435
You get my body back in a power plant...

722
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,562
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

723
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,314
...I'll get you what you want.

724
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,566
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

725
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,985
No. I told you, I don't know them.

726
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,948
I can get you the man who does.

727
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,493
Morpheus.

728
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:26,048
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

729
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,177
Close your eyes, it feels like
you're eating runny eggs.

730
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,096
Or a bowl of snot.

731
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,223
You know what it reminds me of?

732
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,393
Tastee Wheat.
Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?

733
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,729
No, but technically, neither did you.

734
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,023
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

735
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,650
Because you have to wonder...

736
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,153
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

737
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,822
Maybe they got it wrong.

738
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:53,283
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

739
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,577
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

740
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:58,789
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

741
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,041
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

742
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,335
...which is why it tastes like everything.

743
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,379
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

744
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,465
It's a single-celled protein...

745
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,760
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

746
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,262
Everything the body needs.

747
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:16,390
It doesn't have everything the body needs.

748
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:22,229
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

749
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:25,315
You know, I wrote that program.

750
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,900
Here it comes.

751
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,111
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

752
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,531
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

753
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,617
She doesn't talk very much...

754
01:06:35,868 --> 01:06:39,830
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

755
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,456
The digital pimp hard at work.

756
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,959
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.

757
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,087
To deny our own impulses...

758
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:50,465
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

759
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:53,760
Dozer, when you're done...

760
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,554
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

761
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,472
We're going in.

762
01:06:58,182 --> 01:06:59,600
I'm taking Neo to see her.

763
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,771
See who?

764
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,024
The Oracle.

765
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,072
Everyone please observe...

766
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,117
...the "fasten seat belt" and
"no smoking" signs are on.

767
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:20,996
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

768
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:46,438
We're in.

769
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,247
We'll be back in an hour.

770
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,013
Unbelievable...

771
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:21,598
...isn't it?

772
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,020
- God!
- What?

773
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:29,064
I used to eat there.

774
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,943
Really good noodles.

775
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:40,242
I have these memories from my life.

776
01:08:42,703 --> 01:08:44,371
None of them happened.

777
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,331
What does that mean?

778
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,792
That the Matrix cannot
tell you who you are.

779
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,919
But an oracle can?

780
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,587
That's different.

781
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:58,552
Did you go to her?

782
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,263
Yes.

783
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,140
What did she tell you?

784
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:07,894
She told me...

785
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,105
What?

786
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,235
We're here.

787
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,904
Neo, come with me.

788
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,302
So is this the same oracle that made...

789
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:41,720
...the prophecy?

790
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,308
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

791
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:48,769
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

792
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,398
And she knows what? Everything?

793
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,361
She would say she knows enough.

794
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:00,280
And she's never wrong.

795
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:05,660
Try not to think of it in terms
of right and wrong.

796
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,579
She is a guide, Neo.

797
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,831
She can help you to find the path.

798
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,583
She helped you?

799
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,335
Yes.

800
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:15,420
What did she tell you?

801
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,092
That I would find the One.

802
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,357
I told you I can only
show you the door.

803
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:38,151
You have to walk through it.

804
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,031
Hello, Neo.

805
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,950
You're right on time.

806
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:56,670
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

807
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,927
These are the other Potentials.

808
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,720
You can wait here.

809
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:49,097
Do not try and bend the spoon.

810
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:51,600
That's impossible.

811
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,438
Instead, only try to realize the truth.

812
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,356
What truth?

813
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,275
There is no spoon.

814
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,196
There is no spoon?

815
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:08,909
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

816
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,426
The Oracle will you see now.

817
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,688
I know you're Neo.

818
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:40,482
Be right with you.

819
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:43,902
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

820
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:49,491
Not quite what you were expecting, right?

821
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:52,702
Almost done.

822
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,831
Smell good, don't they?

823
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,334
Yeah.

824
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,419
I'd ask you to sit down...

825
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:04,047
...but you're not going to anyway.

826
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:07,425
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

827
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:11,721
That vase.

828
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:13,723
I'm sorry.

829
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:15,850
I said, don't worry about it.

830
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,979
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

831
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:20,814
How did you know?

832
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:26,653
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

833
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:29,948
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

834
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,663
You're cuter than I thought.

835
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,960
I can see why she likes you.

836
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:43,920
Who?

837
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,006
Not too bright, though.

838
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:52,387
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

839
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,682
So...

840
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,018
...what do you think?

841
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,605
Do you think you are the One?

842
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:04,608
I don't know.

843
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:09,446
You know what that means?

844
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,448
It's Latin.

845
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,034
Means, "Know thyself."

846
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,454
I'll let you in on a little secret.

847
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:23,543
Being the One is just like being in love.

848
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:27,130
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

849
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,506
...through and through.

850
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,884
Balls to bones.

851
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,262
Well...

852
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,308
...I'd better have a look at you.

853
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:41,144
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

854
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,202
Okay...

855
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,791
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

856
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,417
Then you say:

857
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:06,294
But what?

858
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:10,507
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

859
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,886
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

860
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,515
You got the gift...

861
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,726
...but it looks like you're
waiting for something.

862
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:27,440
What?

863
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:30,568
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

864
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,405
That's the way these things go.

865
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,866
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

866
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:42,038
He almost had me convinced.

867
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,415
I know.

868
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,085
Poor Morpheus.

869
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,590
Without him, we're lost.

870
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:56,302
What do you mean, "without him"?

871
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,225
Are you sure you want to hear this?

872
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:07,188
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

873
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,067
And no one, not you, not even me...

874
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,570
...can convince him otherwise.

875
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:16,322
He believes it so blindly...

876
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:20,952
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

877
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,328
What?

878
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,165
You're going to have to make a choice.

879
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:29,377
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

880
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:32,756
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

881
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:36,468
One of you is going to die.

882
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,848
Which one will be up to you.

883
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,143
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

884
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:47,061
You have a good soul.

885
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,857
And I hate giving good people bad news.

886
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,445
Don't worry about it.

887
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,114
As soon as you step outside that door...

888
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,492
...you'll start feeling better.

889
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:04,996
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

890
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,583
You're in control of your own life.

891
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,710
Remember?

892
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,588
Here...

893
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,008
...take a cookie.

894
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,887
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

895
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,224
...you'll feel right as rain.

896
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:34,776
What was said...

897
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,861
...was for you...

898
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,239
...and for you alone.

899
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,263
They're on the way.

900
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,127
What is that?

901
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:50,310
Oh, déjà vu.

902
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:54,898
What did you just say?

903
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:56,649
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.

904
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,526
- What did you see?
- What happened?

905
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,113
A black cat went past us...

906
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,990
...then another just like it.

907
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,783
Was it the same cat?

908
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:09,579
- I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

909
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:14,876
What is it?

910
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:19,547
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix
when they change something.

911
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,760
Oh, my God.

912
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:26,554
Let's go.

913
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,603
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

914
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:40,318
Oh, no.

915
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:23,069
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

916
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,196
Be calm. Give me your phone.

917
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:26,990
They'll be able to track it.

918
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,658
We have no choice.

919
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,285
Operator.

920
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:34,455
Find a structural drawing of this building.
Find it fast.

921
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,882
- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.

922
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:48,970
Eighth floor.

923
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,763
They're on the eighth floor.

924
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,515
Switch, straight ahead.

925
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,434
Neo...

926
01:21:00,565 --> 01:21:02,692
I hope the Oracle gave you
some good news.

927
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,493
Now left. That's it.

928
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:13,828
Good.

929
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,839
Where are they?

930
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,442
They're in the walls.

931
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,070
In the walls!

932
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,135
It's an agent!

933
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:00,768
Morpheus!

934
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,186
You must get Neo out!

935
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,272
He's all that matters!

936
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:06,774
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

937
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,068
Go!

938
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,243
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

939
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,352
Cypher, come on!

940
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:52,111
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

941
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,779
And you are?

942
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,781
A Smith.

943
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,325
Agent Smith.

944
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,952
You all look the same to me.

945
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:56,884
Take him.

946
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:04,976
No!

947
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:11,941
- Operator.
- I need an exit, fast.

948
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,946
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

949
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,073
All of a sudden, boom.

950
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:20,700
Somebody up there still likes me.

951
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,201
I got you.

952
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:24,620
Just get me out of here fast.

953
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,540
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

954
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:28,833
Right.

955
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,546
- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.

956
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:34,964
Is Morpheus alive?

957
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,632
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

958
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,968
Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.

959
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,470
He's alive. We need an exit.

960
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:42,805
You're not far from Cypher.

961
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,223
- Cypher?
- I know.

962
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,559
- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.

963
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,861
Got him.

964
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:08,831
Where are they?

965
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,333
Making the call.

966
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,168
Good.

967
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:26,557
You first.

968
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:30,978
Shit!

969
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:35,941
Tank!

970
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,735
No!

971
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,822
I don't know. It just went dead.

972
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:09,850
Hello, Trinity.

973
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,602
Cypher? Where's Tank?

974
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,234
You know...

975
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:22,071
...for a long time...

976
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,158
...I thought I was in love with you.

977
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:28,994
I used to dream about you.

978
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,790
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

979
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,418
Too bad things had to turn out this way.

980
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,002
You killed them.

981
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,004
- What?
- Oh, God.

982
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:40,673
I'm tired, Trinity.

983
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:43,968
I'm tired of this war...

984
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,096
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

985
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:52,059
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

986
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,396
But most of all...

987
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:59,358
...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.

988
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,777
Surprise, asshole!

989
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,530
I bet you never saw this coming...

990
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,823
...did you?

991
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:10,494
God, I wish I could be there...

992
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,580
...when they break you.

993
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,792
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

994
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,211
...so right then...

995
01:28:19,462 --> 01:28:20,796
...you'd know it was me.

996
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:22,465
You gave them Morpheus.

997
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:24,175
He lied to us, Trinity.

998
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,260
He tricked us!

999
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,804
If you had told us the truth...

1000
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,932
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1001
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:34,310
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1002
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,438
"Free." You call this free?

1003
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:42,359
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1004
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,864
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1005
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,241
...I choose the Matrix.

1006
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:51,160
The Matrix isn't real.

1007
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,828
I disagree, Trinity.

1008
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,331
I think the Matrix...

1009
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,250
...can be more real than this world.

1010
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,922
All I do is pull the plug here.

1011
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,507
But there...

1012
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:07,343
...you have to watch Apoc die.

1013
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:09,595
Trinity.

1014
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,062
- Welcome to the real world.
- But you're out, Cypher.

1015
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:20,731
- You can't go back.
- That's what you think.

1016
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,483
They'll reinsert my body.

1017
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:26,362
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.

1018
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,613
By the way...

1019
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,824
...if you have anything
important to say to Switch...

1020
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,409
...say it now.

1021
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:35,704
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1022
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,041
Not like this.

1023
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:44,547
Too late.

1024
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,590
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1025
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,717
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1026
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,970
I'm just a messenger.

1027
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:54,557
And right now, I'm going to prove it to you.

1028
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,309
If Morpheus was right...

1029
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,728
...there's no way I can pull this plug.

1030
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,814
If Neo's the One...

1031
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,149
...then there'd have to be...

1032
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,986
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1033
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,362
Right?

1034
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:11,073
I mean, how can he be the One...

1035
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,324
...if he's dead?

1036
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:15,953
You never did answer me before...

1037
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:18,581
...if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.

1038
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:22,167
Come on. All I want is a little yes or no.

1039
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,879
Look into his eyes...

1040
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,132
...those big, pretty eyes...

1041
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,219
...and tell me...

1042
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,179
...yes...

1043
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:35,889
...or no.

1044
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,726
- Yes.
- No!

1045
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,060
I don't believe it.

1046
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:46,233
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1047
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,878
You first.

1048
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,388
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1049
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:20,351
Dozer?

1050
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:40,996
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1051
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:45,000
Marveled at its beauty...

1052
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:47,628
...its genius?

1053
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:50,673
Billions of people...

1054
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:53,676
...just living out their lives.

1055
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,387
Oblivious.

1056
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:03,852
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1057
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:08,774
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1058
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,194
...where everyone would be happy.

1059
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,238
It was a disaster.

1060
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:18,826
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1061
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:21,453
Some believe that...

1062
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:26,083
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1063
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,876
But I believe that...

1064
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,211
...as a species...

1065
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:33,298
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1066
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:34,925
...and suffering.

1067
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:37,886
So the perfect world was a dream...

1068
01:32:38,137 --> 01:32:42,975
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1069
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,980
Which is why the Matrix
was redesigned to this.

1070
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:49,940
The peak...

1071
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,608
...of your civilization.

1072
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:54,111
I say, "your civilization"...

1073
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:58,490
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1074
01:32:58,741 --> 01:33:01,827
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1075
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:05,748
Evolution, Morpheus.

1076
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:07,374
Evolution.

1077
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,545
Like the dinosaur.

1078
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,340
Look out that window.

1079
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,177
You had your time.

1080
01:33:18,886 --> 01:33:22,806
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1081
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,517
The future is our time.

1082
01:33:29,772 --> 01:33:30,939
There could be a problem.

1083
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:35,235
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1084
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:37,654
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1085
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,114
How much time?

1086
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,493
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1087
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:47,164
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1088
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:50,375
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1089
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:51,668
What do they want?

1090
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:55,964
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1091
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:59,134
If an agent got the codes and
got into Zion's mainframe...

1092
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:02,471
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1093
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,890
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1094
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:06,225
...or you...

1095
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:07,684
...or even Morpheus.

1096
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,148
There has to be something we can do.

1097
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,567
There is. We pull the plug.

1098
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:20,405
You're going to kill him?

1099
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:21,824
Kill Morpheus?

1100
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:24,076
We don't have a choice.

1101
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:33,794
Never send a human to do a machine's job.

1102
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,796
If the insider has failed...

1103
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:39,258
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1104
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:41,218
They're dead. In either case...

1105
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:45,013
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1106
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:46,348
Immediately.

1107
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,273
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1108
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,442
You were a father.

1109
01:34:58,986 --> 01:35:00,946
We'll miss you always.

1110
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,037
Stop!

1111
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:11,540
I don't believe this is happening.

1112
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,750
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1113
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:15,919
I don't know.

1114
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:18,714
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1115
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,173
The Oracle.

1116
01:35:20,424 --> 01:35:22,217
She told me this would happen.

1117
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,805
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1118
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,473
What choice?

1119
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,979
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1120
01:35:34,313 --> 01:35:36,648
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1121
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:40,485
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1122
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:42,654
There is no way that you're going back in.

1123
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,491
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1124
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:49,036
What?

1125
01:35:49,745 --> 01:35:51,371
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1126
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:54,708
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1127
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,628
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1128
01:35:58,295 --> 01:35:59,546
No, Neo, that's not true.

1129
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,758
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1130
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:10,515
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1131
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:15,145
Even if you somehow got inside,
those are agents holding him. Three of them.

1132
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:20,359
I want Morpheus back too,
but what you're talking about is suicide.

1133
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:22,194
That's what it looks like...

1134
01:36:22,361 --> 01:36:23,403
...but it's not.

1135
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:26,031
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1136
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,827
Morpheus believed something,
and he was ready to give his life for it.

1137
01:36:31,078 --> 01:36:34,081
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1138
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:36,875
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1139
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:38,669
What?

1140
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:41,088
I believe I can bring him back.

1141
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,982
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1142
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,275
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1143
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,570
Let me tell you what I believe.

1144
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:08,448
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1145
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:13,078
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1146
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,372
And since I am the ranking officer...

1147
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:18,500
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1148
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,670
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1149
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:23,630
Tank...

1150
01:37:23,797 --> 01:37:24,923
...load us up.

1151
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:37,853
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1152
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:39,813
...during my time here.

1153
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:44,067
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1154
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,570
...and I realized...

1155
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,114
...that you're not actually mammals.

1156
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:53,785
Every mammal on this planet...

1157
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:59,041
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1158
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:01,126
But you humans do not.

1159
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:05,213
You move to an area and you multiply...

1160
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:09,968
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1161
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:12,387
The only way you can survive...

1162
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:15,640
...is to spread to another area.

1163
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:23,940
There is another organism on this planet...

1164
01:38:24,191 --> 01:38:26,151
...that follows the same pattern.

1165
01:38:26,777 --> 01:38:28,445
Do you know what it is?

1166
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,655
A virus.

1167
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,035
Human beings are a disease.

1168
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,953
A cancer of this planet.

1169
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:39,331
You are a plague.

1170
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:41,291
And we...

1171
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,834
...are the cure.

1172
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,253
Okay, so what do you need?

1173
01:38:45,879 --> 01:38:47,005
Besides a miracle.

1174
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,799
Guns.

1175
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:50,842
Lots of guns.

1176
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:01,937
Neo...

1177
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,233
No one has ever done anything like this.

1178
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,361
That's why it's going to work.

1179
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,367
Why isn't the serum working?

1180
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:18,286
Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.

1181
01:39:20,372 --> 01:39:21,623
Leave me with him.

1182
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:25,335
Now.

1183
01:39:36,555 --> 01:39:38,140
Hold on, Morpheus.

1184
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:41,101
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1185
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,605
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1186
01:39:45,856 --> 01:39:48,525
I'm going to be honest...

1187
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,110
...with you.

1188
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:55,907
I...

1189
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:57,909
...hate...

1190
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,120
...this place...

1191
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,747
...this zoo...

1192
01:40:02,998 --> 01:40:04,124
...this prison...

1193
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:07,544
...this reality, whatever you want to call it.

1194
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:10,088
I can't stand it any longer.

1195
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:12,716
It's the smell.

1196
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,969
If there is such a thing.

1197
01:40:16,303 --> 01:40:19,598
I feel saturated by it.

1198
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:22,392
I can...

1199
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,186
...taste...

1200
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,396
...your stink.

1201
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:30,275
And every time I do, I fear that I
have somehow been infected by it.

1202
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:31,443
It's repulsive.

1203
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:33,820
Isn't it?

1204
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:38,283
I must get out of here.

1205
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,911
I must get free.

1206
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:44,039
And in this mind is the key.

1207
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:45,957
My key.

1208
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,085
Once Zion is destroyed, there
is no need for me to be here.

1209
01:40:49,336 --> 01:40:50,962
Do you understand?

1210
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,631
I need the codes.

1211
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:55,217
I have to get inside Zion...

1212
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,053
...and you have to tell me how.

1213
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:00,347
You're going to tell me...

1214
01:41:00,597 --> 01:41:02,766
...or you're going to die.

1215
01:41:22,953 --> 01:41:26,081
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1216
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,044
Holy shit!

1217
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,850
Backup. Send backup.

1218
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:10,792
Freeze!

1219
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:26,845
What were you doing?

1220
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,973
He doesn't know.

1221
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:31,724
Know what?

1222
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:02,297
I think they're trying to save him.

1223
01:45:17,145 --> 01:45:18,897
There is no spoon.

1224
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:50,678
Find them and destroy them!

1225
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:54,140
We're under attack!

1226
01:46:26,256 --> 01:46:27,423
Trinity!

1227
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:29,008
Help!

1228
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:52,240
Only human.

1229
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,284
Dodge this.

1230
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:09,007
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1231
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:13,344
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1232
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,847
It wasn't fast enough.

1233
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:19,892
Can you fly that thing?

1234
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:22,020
Not yet.

1235
01:47:25,315 --> 01:47:26,357
Operator.

1236
01:47:26,566 --> 01:47:29,736
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.

1237
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,487
Hurry.

1238
01:47:39,412 --> 01:47:41,039
Let's go.

1239
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:57,221
No.

1240
01:48:48,815 --> 01:48:51,442
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1241
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,523
He's not going to make it.

1242
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:41,367
Got you.

1243
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:48,601
Trinity!

1244
01:51:30,268 --> 01:51:31,686
I knew it.

1245
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:33,521
He's the One.

1246
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:51,706
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1247
01:51:54,584 --> 01:51:55,751
Morpheus...

1248
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,504
The Oracle.

1249
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:02,133
- She told me...
- She told you...

1250
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:04,093
...what you needed to hear.

1251
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:05,720
That's all.

1252
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:09,724
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1253
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,351
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1254
01:52:13,102 --> 01:52:14,395
...and walking the path.

1255
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,649
- Operator.
- Tank.

1256
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:22,111
- It's good to hear your voice.
- We need an exit.

1257
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:25,156
Got one ready.
Subway station, State and Balboa.

1258
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,630
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1259
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,467
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1260
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:47,678
Order the strike.

1261
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,228
They're not out yet.

1262
01:53:07,406 --> 01:53:08,741
You first, Morpheus.

1263
01:53:29,428 --> 01:53:31,722
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1264
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:38,938
...but I'm afraid of what
it could mean if I do.

1265
01:53:42,525 --> 01:53:45,820
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1266
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,116
Everything but this.

1267
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:52,660
But what?

1268
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,728
Neo!

1269
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:20,604
- What happened?
- An agent.

1270
01:54:20,855 --> 01:54:22,773
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1271
01:54:24,817 --> 01:54:26,777
Mr. Anderson.

1272
01:54:28,988 --> 01:54:30,364
Run, Neo. Run.

1273
01:54:35,661 --> 01:54:37,288
What is he doing?

1274
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:38,789
He's beginning to believe.

1275
01:55:05,775 --> 01:55:07,151
You're empty.

1276
01:55:07,735 --> 01:55:09,028
So are you.

1277
01:55:42,186 --> 01:55:45,189
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1278
01:55:46,315 --> 01:55:47,358
...Mr. Anderson.

1279
01:56:28,315 --> 01:56:30,401
Jesus, he's killing him.

1280
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,697
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1281
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:02,451
That is the sound of inevitability.

1282
01:58:05,037 --> 01:58:08,374
It is the sound of your death.

1283
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:11,627
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1284
01:58:11,877 --> 01:58:13,504
My name...

1285
01:58:16,507 --> 01:58:18,550
...is Neo.

1286
01:58:50,791 --> 01:58:53,002
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1287
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:56,547
Oh, shit.

1288
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,394
Sentinels.

1289
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:13,397
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1290
01:59:15,441 --> 01:59:17,609
Tank, charge the EMP.

1291
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:20,904
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1292
01:59:22,072 --> 01:59:23,157
He's gonna make it.

1293
01:59:23,407 --> 01:59:25,284
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1294
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:28,412
What the shit? That's my phone!

1295
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:30,414
That guy took my phone!

1296
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:35,085
Got him!
He's on the run.

1297
01:59:35,336 --> 01:59:38,005
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1298
01:59:38,255 --> 01:59:40,132
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.

1299
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:45,095
Oh, shit!

1300
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:08,660
Help! Need a little help!

1301
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:11,497
The door.

1302
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:28,972
The door on your left.

1303
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,141
Your other left!

1304
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:39,108
The back door.

1305
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,004
Oh, no.

1306
02:01:02,673 --> 02:01:04,174
Here they come.

1307
02:01:32,953 --> 02:01:34,204
He's going to make it.

1308
02:01:44,423 --> 02:01:47,551
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.

1309
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:23,754
They're inside.

1310
02:02:26,089 --> 02:02:27,132
Hurry, Neo.

1311
02:03:23,355 --> 02:03:24,481
It can't be.

1312
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:33,657
Check him.

1313
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:39,204
He's gone.

1314
02:03:45,919 --> 02:03:48,338
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1315
02:03:55,929 --> 02:03:56,972
Neo...

1316
02:03:58,432 --> 02:04:00,392
I'm not afraid anymore.

1317
02:04:02,019 --> 02:04:03,353
The Oracle told me...

1318
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:08,942
...I'd fall in love, and that the man
I loved would be the One.

1319
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,031
So you see...

1320
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:16,742
...you can't be dead.

1321
02:04:18,327 --> 02:04:20,162
You can't be...

1322
02:04:21,705 --> 02:04:23,874
...because I love you.

1323
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:27,419
You hear me?

1324
02:04:28,545 --> 02:04:30,213
I love you.

1325
02:04:53,945 --> 02:04:55,238
Now, get up.

1326
02:05:03,914 --> 02:05:05,082
No.

1327
02:05:31,817 --> 02:05:32,859
How?

1328
02:05:33,735 --> 02:05:34,778
He is the One.

1329
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:02,991
Neo!

1330
02:07:59,256 --> 02:08:00,966
I know you're out there.

1331
02:08:01,216 --> 02:08:03,051
I can feel you now.

1332
02:08:03,468 --> 02:08:07,097
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.

1333
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,266
You're afraid of change.

1334
02:08:10,725 --> 02:08:12,060
I don't know the future.

1335
02:08:12,227 --> 02:08:14,813
I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.

1336
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:18,024
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.

1337
02:08:18,984 --> 02:08:20,569
I'll hang up this phone.

1338
02:08:20,819 --> 02:08:23,905
And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.

1339
02:08:24,155 --> 02:08:26,032
I'm going to show them a world...

1340
02:08:26,283 --> 02:08:28,034
...without you.

1341
02:08:28,326 --> 02:08:31,955
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.

1342
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:35,917
A world where anything is possible.

1343
02:08:38,545 --> 02:08:39,880
Where we go from there...

1344
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:42,090
...is a choice I leave to you.
