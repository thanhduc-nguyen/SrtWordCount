1
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:12,345
This is Jim Cameron.
I wrote and directed this film back in '83,

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,889
and directed it in '85 through '86.

3
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:21,396
It was released in the summer of '86.
July 1 7th, if l'm not mistaken.

4
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,564
It started as a treatment.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:29,654
I was having a meeting with David Giler and
Walter Hill, talking about another project,

6
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,782
and that pitch was not going very well.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,495
I could tell by their sagging expressions
that they didn't like any of my ideas.

8
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,541
But they had read my Terminator script
and wanted to work with me on something.

9
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,628
I was getting up
and making my way toward the door

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,965
and David Giler,
one of the producers of the first film,

11
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:53,302
said "We do have this other thing",
and I said "What's that?"

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,847
He said "Alien 2."

13
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,185
And all the pinball machine lights
and bells went off inside my head

14
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:05,481
but I maintained a straight face
and said "That could be interesting."

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:10,069
And I suggested that I write
a quick treatment, a quick outline,

16
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,030
just to give them an idea
of what I might do with it.

17
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:17,535
So I raced home and stayed up for three days
straight, drank about eight pots of coffee

18
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,955
and wrote a 40- or 50-page treatment.

19
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:26,419
Really what I did was I adapted a story I had
already written, which was called Mother,

20
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,840
which was an "alien on a space station"
kind of story.

21
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,551
It had the power loader machine in it.

22
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,262
I had written this treatment
a few months earlier.

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,184
So I adapted it, dropped Sigourney's
character and a bunch of marines into it,

24
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:47,482
and in that one quick stroke
created all the character names -

25
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,360
Gorman and Hicks and Vasquez
and all those folks -

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,281
and dropped it on them
a couple of days later.

27
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,703
I think they felt like they'd hit the jackpot.
That was the film they wanted to make.

28
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:06,751
So they authorized me to go ahead and start
writing the script. The problem was, that day

29
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,671
I landed the job to write the script
for the second Rambo film.

30
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,175
So I called them up
and asked David Giler what l should do.

31
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:18,679
And he said "Don't be stupid.
Take both jobs." So I took both jobs.

32
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:23,267
I also had to do a rewrite of my Terminator
script to start production in February,

33
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,188
so I had a three-month period
where I had to write three scripts.

34
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:33,402
So I decided that each script was gonna be
two hours long, so it'd be 120 pages.

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,032
So I figured out the total page count,
whatever that is - I guess 360 pages.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,079
I divided the total number of waking hours
I had during that three-month period by 360

37
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,915
and figured out how many pages
per hour l had to write,

38
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,418
and then I just wrote
that many pages per hour.

39
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,338
I'm Gale Anne Hurd. I produced Aliens.

40
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm Stan Winston. I created the creature
effects and the alien effects for Aliens.

41
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,306
(Hurd) I remember Jim trying to figure out

42
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,477
how he could make the beginning
of this movie impressive.

43
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:11,524
He said he wanted to use a robotic laser.

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,194
It was an afterthought
and it wasn't in the budget

45
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:20,324
and I remember having the gall to say to him
"If you wanna use it, you have to pay for it."

46
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,451
- And he did.
- (Winston) Is that right?

47
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:27,456
(Hurd) This robotic arm and the laser
came out of his pocket.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,042
(Cameron) I wanted a seamless blend

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,463
from the end of the first film
into the beginning of the second film.

50
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,718
I certainly wanted to honor all the things
that were good about the first film.

51
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:43,097
So I went to school
on Ridley's style of photography,

52
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,349
which was quite different from mine,

53
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,979
cos he used a lot of long lenses, much
more so than I was used to working with.

54
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:55,484
But the smoke, the backlight, the textures,
the way he forces the frame

55
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:01,824
by putting a lot of equipment, machinery and
foreground pieces, I really studied all that.

56
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,493
I wanted there to be a
stylistic continuity.

57
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,998
I also wanted to have
my own style grafted onto that

58
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:14,921
so that I felt enough of a sense of
authorship to make it worth doing.

59
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:28,017
This is Robert Skotak. I was
the visual effects supervisor on the film.

60
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:33,022
My name is Dennis Skotak. l was supervising
director of photography on this project.

61
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,652
This is Pat McClung. I was the
model-shop supervisor on the film.

62
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,155
(Robert) They're wearing
modified costumes from Outland,

63
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:46,160
or the basic suit is from Outland and it's been
redesigned and they put some stencils on it.

64
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:52,291
This is microglitter
and fuller's earth blown on there.

65
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,548
(Hurd) I remember in this scene the batteries
in the flashlights kept going out.

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,426
You would think
this would be an easy scene to do,

67
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,055
but, as with everything in this movie,
it was harder than it looked.

68
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,725
(Winston) There are no
easy scenes with Jim.

69
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,564
(Robert) There's that nice dissolve,
the contour of the earth matching her face.

70
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,070
(Dennis) When we shot this, a matte painting
combined with miniature and perspective,

71
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,990
there are some perspective gags
going on there.

72
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,410
We used a clip of Sigourney's face
in the viewfinder

73
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:32,623
to line up the curvature of the earth,
so we had a nice match.

74
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,171
(Cameron) I wrote the piece obviously
with Sigourney in mind for the character.

75
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,342
I was told she was on board and I should
just toddle off and write the film

76
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,929
when in fact no deal
had been made with her whatsoever.

77
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,641
So here was a script that was written
that everybody wanted to make,

78
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,729
in which she was in every scene,
and they hadn't made a deal with her yet.

79
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,941
That's why she got her first big payday
of her acting career.

80
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,485
She got a million bucks,
which was a big deal.

81
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:08,367
She might have been the first actress to get a
million dollars for a movie in movie history.

82
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,746
It was all because it was mishandled
by the producers.

83
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,499
She was the main character
and they hadn't made the deal.

84
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:22,798
She was worth every penny of it and more.
When people saw the film, they realized that.

85
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,259
I knew what a phenomenal actress
she was.

86
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,138
I'd never met her. I had her picture up
while I was writing the script.

87
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,141
I went off the character that
had been created in the first film,

88
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,894
took her much further.

89
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,441
Of course, this is Paul Reiser.

90
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:47,323
I certainly had no idea what a great
comic actor he would prove to be,

91
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,410
and certainly that's how people think
of him, not as a dramatic actor.

92
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,998
I just read him in a lineup of actors
in the normal casting methodology,

93
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,584
and I thought he was really interesting,

94
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,671
that he could play this really sincere
but slightly smarmy guy

95
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,341
who could then turn evil.

96
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,722
This is a dream sequence,
but you don't know that yet.

97
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,725
I remember from
the premiere screening of the film

98
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:21,816
that the incomplete chestburster scene here
really got people cranked up and on edge,

99
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:27,321
set the tone for the whole movie,
that you were here to be messed with,

100
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,116
which is a good way to start off, l think.

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,078
The way you get a cat to hiss like that
is you put another cat close to it.

102
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,957
I had no idea. I didn't know
what you did to make a cat do that.

103
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:44,880
But that's standard procedure. Bring a cat it
doesn't know close to it and it'll do that.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,511
This scene was shot really quickly.

105
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:56,392
It was pretty much all handheld,
48 or 60 frames a second. I think 48.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,107
Then Sigourney had to loop all her lines
at slow speed, which is always odd.

107
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,069
(Winston) Our first effect in the movie.

108
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:12,658
It's great, because it's what you expected
to happen and then it's not what you expect.

109
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,121
She was actually under the bed
for that sequence.

110
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,127
We built an artificial body from her neck
down. Someone is under the bed with her.

111
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:29,717
I can't remember who the lucky guy was that
created the illusion of the chestburster.

112
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:35,264
- Pushing its way through her.
- It sets up the character.

113
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,558
This is her nightmare.

114
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,604
You know that she never wants
to have to face it in real life again

115
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:47,026
because she's haunted by it
in her dreams and her nightmares.

116
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,656
(Robert) This effect is
as if you're outdoors.

117
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,785
When the camera dollies over,
you see it's just a video projection.

118
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,288
The idea was that in outer space

119
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:04,418
there would be places you could go to get a
feeling you were in a natural environment.

120
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,672
So that plate behind her was shot
out in the garden at Pinewood Studios.

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,799
It was a VistaVision plate.

122
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:16,805
Originally, there was supposed to be a
birdhouse in the background in that garden,

123
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,309
and she would have Jones on her lap
and a bird would fly in

124
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,020
and Jones would jump up
and hit the screen

125
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:29,318
and that's how the audience would find out
that she wasn't actually on the earth.

126
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,490
This scene was cut
from the release version of the film,

127
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,035
which became the source
of some controversy with Sigourney.

128
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:43,624
She later said in print that she had based
her entire character on this scene,

129
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,628
and she was devastated
when it was removed.

130
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,715
At the time she first screened the film,
she told me she didn't like the scene,

131
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,844
and then we wound up reading interviews
where she had a big problem with that.

132
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,099
We didn't have a chance to talk about it
because of the postproduction schedule.

133
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,520
We were working in England,
kind of in isolation.

134
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:14,363
Even though I liked the symmetry of the fact
that she had had a daughter and lost her -

135
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,283
that's Sigourney's mother,
so there's an interesting inversion here.

136
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,079
She's looking at the face of her mother
but playing it as her daughter.

137
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,040
As an actor, it allowed her
to work the connection.

138
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,001
All my movies are love stories.

139
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,755
This one is about parental love,
protectiveness and a sense of duty,

140
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:36,635
and the ultimate sacrifice that a person
would make, given that sense of duty.

141
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,722
That was a nice touch.
That was Sigourney's idea.

142
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,599
(Hurd) This was one of
the seminal scenes in the movie

143
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,812
and was one of the ones
that had to be deleted and omitted

144
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,440
from the theatrical version
because of length.

145
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,026
We didn't have multiplexes,

146
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:56,238
and there were only so many showings
a day that you could have of a film,

147
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,950
and we had to get it
no more than two hours ten minutes

148
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:05,164
in order to get the maximum number
of screenings per day.

149
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:11,920
(Cameron) Peter Lamont came up with a simple
and austere look for our future sets.

150
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:17,176
I watched this film recently
and I was amazed at how little we see

151
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,722
of the conventional future world,
as opposed to the spacecraft interiors.

152
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,727
She's actually on Gateway Station here.
She hasn't returned all the way to earth.

153
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:32,232
She never sets foot on earth in the whole
series of films, which is interesting.

154
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,527
This is as close as she gets
until the end of the fourth movie,

155
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,113
where she's re-entering the atmosphere.

156
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,241
But this is earth
for all intents and purposes.

157
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,788
This is everyday life
circa a couple of hundred years from now.

158
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,333
And Peter came up
with a very spartan look.

159
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:54,379
It's not overworked at all,
which I think was quite clever.

160
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,801
We wanted to do it minimalist. We didn't
have her walking around corridors.

161
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,179
We didn't create a world
because we weren't interested.

162
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,682
We were interested
in the through-line of her story

163
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,311
and her character's
dilemma and problems,

164
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:15,692
the fact that she's not believed, that she
understands there's this great threat.

165
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,028
The same applied to the costumes.

166
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:23,075
We didn't wanna suggest a wildly
separated future from our present one.

167
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:29,414
This might be one of the first science fiction
movies where men still wear coats and ties.

168
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,501
The thinking was
people will still wear coats and ties.

169
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,506
They may not look exactly the same.
We turned up the collar on the jackets.

170
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,385
It's no big deal but it's a subtle change.
We wanted to have a place to go.

171
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,639
We wanted the space environment once
they get to the colony planet to be exotic

172
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,933
and so we didn't wanna overwork earth.

173
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,521
We also wanted to understand who these
people were, and a suit is a suit.

174
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,858
These characters are suits
and we wanted to reinforce that.

175
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:01,238
If everybody's in Star Wars type costumes,
it's harder to relate to them as characters.

176
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,032
I was thinking more of a writer
than a designer

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,035
when l was making my picks
of what things should look like

178
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,957
from amongst the suggestions
made by the costume designer.

179
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,921
(McClung) Denny, did they shoot
at 25 frames per second

180
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,882
for all the video playback stuff?

181
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,383
Do you remember?

182
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,721
(Dennis) They did.
The 24-frame issue was messy.

183
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,141
It can be done,
but it's such a big procedure.

184
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,978
Shooting 25 frames per second
on the camera

185
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,107
puts the video in sync
with the film camera very easily.

186
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:42,487
There's a slight speed differential
but it's almost impossible to perceive.

187
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,158
(McClung) In Britain they have
a different television system,

188
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,202
a 25-frame-per-second system.

189
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,788
(Robert) 625 resolution instead of 525.

190
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:57,586
(Dennis) Later in the film
there's some video footage that was used,

191
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,589
appearing on video monitors.

192
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,134
But the PAL system is better than NTSC,

193
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,179
which is our system here
in the United States.

194
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:14,102
It almost looked like a slightly too fuzzy
version of film, sort of in between.

195
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,733
It's not as good as it should be for film,

196
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,236
but it wasn't obvious it was video.

197
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:29,117
Jim realized and made
the video images noisier

198
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,247
or break up more often
so it was more obvious.

199
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,376
(Cameron) The tag of this scene
is gonna be a throw to this big sequence

200
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,004
that takes place on the colony
which is before the aliens attack.

201
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,132
That's cut out of the release version,

202
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,720
so coming up is the biggest single change
from the release version of the film.

203
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:55,394
It's an entire reel. I'll never forget Gale
Hurd, who was my wife and producer at the time,

204
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,232
trying to shorten the film by 20 minutes.

205
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,652
I just could not see how it was possible

206
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,783
to do a cut here, a cut there, a few seconds,
a bit of a scene, the tag of a scene maybe.

207
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,495
She said "I've been thinking
about this for days." I said "Go ahead."

208
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,166
She said "Reel three." Which starts here.
"You can take out reel three."

209
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,253
I immediately rejected that
as completely absurd.

210
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,673
Then I thought about it.
Reel three ends with Newt's scream

211
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,218
when her father
has the facehugger on his face.

212
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:33,098
It works flawlessly. It's a brilliant cut
and I have to credit Gale with that.

213
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:39,187
I had poured a lot of energy into the design
of these scenes and the alien derelict ship.

214
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,482
The problem for me
was that I couldn't imagine this film

215
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,737
without the cognitive tether
to the first film of the alien derelict,

216
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,197
but it turns out that it works perfectly.

217
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,367
A little dialogue bridge and it works fine.

218
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:59,791
I like this tractor a lot, this tractor
with this articulated leg design.

219
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,254
(Dennis) This is one of my favorite
effects. You see the big tractor driving by

220
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:09,843
and in the background you see these people
struggling to put a tarp over that tractor.

221
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,889
That was done in perspective.
There were full-size people back there,

222
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,225
and a miniature in the foreground
with distance between.

223
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:23,106
It put everything in camera all at one time
without any opticals or anything beyond that.

224
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:27,861
The trick was that the actors had to act
at double their normal speed of acting,

225
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,864
because the camera
was running at 48 frames per second.

226
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,993
(Robert) We had a Ritter fan on them
to really kick those tarps around

227
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,579
in excess of what it would be in real time,

228
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:42,626
but because we were overcranking,
that motion would then look normal.

229
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:47,339
(McClung) The multi-wheeled vehicle at the
beginning is a fifth-scale miniature,

230
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,342
radio-controlled, that Jim designed.

231
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:56,306
On the airplane coming over from
Los Angeles to London he just doodled it.

232
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,601
Ron Cobb, I believe, fleshed it out.

233
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,194
(Cameron) I always liked these guys.
I always liked this

234
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,697
"I'm just trying to do my job.
I'm a working stiff in a situation."

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,284
"The guys back home never know
what we're going through."

236
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,870
We wanted the idea
that there were kids around,

237
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,208
that the colonists had come
with their families.

238
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,377
This is a connection to the first film.

239
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,631
The Weyland-Yutani Corporation
was the big, bad, evil company

240
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,970
that was responsible for everything
that went wrong in the first movie.

241
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,306
So we just carried that tradition on.

242
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,018
Ultimately, l think
that what this scene shows

243
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,063
is that at that time I was not
- maybe never -

244
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,816
as good as Ridley Scott
at what he does best.

245
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,486
The suspense and the creation
of the atmosphere of this planet

246
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,406
is done so much better by him in his film,

247
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:59,828
and so, in a way, the removal of this scene
makes the picture stronger

248
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,956
because it puts it more on its own turf.

249
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:08,170
We tried to recreate the alien ship but I don't
think we were quite as successful as he was.

250
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:14,676
In his film it was a major set piece.
In ours it was just a stop along the way.

251
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,183
(Dennis) This derelict ship
had been in Bob Burns' driveway.

252
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,978
He'd been given it by Fox
and it was starting to fall apart.

253
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,148
We had to put it back together
and fix it up.

254
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,735
Fortunately, though, it existed,
so it saved us a lot of model work

255
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:38,408
because it was there and mostly intact,
rather than building from scratch.

256
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,120
My name's Carrie Henn and I was Newt.

257
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,665
My name's Chris Henn
and I was Tim Jordan.

258
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,753
(Carrie) It's cool to see
what James Cameron had in mind,

259
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,381
cos at the time
we didn't really know what was going on.

260
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,885
Little did we know at this time
that our life would change

261
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,096
when they came back from inside.

262
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,141
(Chris) That was the first time
we saw the facehugger,

263
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,647
when we opened the door and we saw it
on Jay's - who played our dad - neck.

264
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,566
(Carrie) I was really sad for my brother
that this got cut out,

265
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,069
and for everyone watching it,

266
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:18,907
because it shows everyone why I can't
stand the aliens, pretty obvious anyway,

267
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:23,537
but you find out that my dad was the one
who brought it back to the colony.

268
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:29,960
(Chris) It shows how Sigourney and Newt get
the connection, too, as mother-daughter,

269
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,837
and they have the same enemy.

270
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,967
(Carrie) This was interesting,
cos it wasn't something we saw filmed.

271
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:41,763
When it happened, they just got
out of the car and that was it.

272
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:49,104
(Chris) It ties it to the first one. It's the
same place they went in the first movie.

273
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,148
(Winston) We have another one
of our first creature effects

274
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,152
that is like the introduction
of the facehugger.

275
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,531
All of these things were so daunting
to me psychologically,

276
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,827
because these had now
become iconic characters,

277
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,747
the facehugger and the chestburster
and the warrior aliens.

278
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,001
Of course, the queen was brand-new,

279
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:16,756
but we also wanted each of these
to have their own life in this movie

280
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,634
and at the same time
be legitimate to the original.

281
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:25,056
So, to the very discerning eye, if you look at
the facehugger from the original, from Alien,

282
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:30,061
and you look at the facehugger in Aliens,
there are subtle differences in the detail,

283
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,983
more attention to detail
as far as the creature itself.

284
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:43,491
- (Carrie) That was genuine scare.
- (Chris) That freaked us both out.

285
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,871
(Carrie) This is where James Cameron
asked me to scream for the first time ever

286
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,499
and I screamed
and everyone stopped and stared.

287
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,002
(Cameron) Could shatter glass
with her scream.

288
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,673
I always liked that sound cut. We spent
a lot of time on the sound on this picture.

289
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,927
The picture was mixed by Graham Hartstone
at Pinewood Studios in England.

290
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,222
I remember mixing it for a long time,
I think seven weeks.

291
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,643
There's some really nice sound work
and I learned a lot.

292
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,939
My only prior experience with a mix was on
Terminator and that was done really rapidly.

293
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,817
I'm thinking it was done
in four or five days.

294
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,863
Not a sophisticated mix
and I knew nothing about it,

295
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:27,035
so I learned an awful lot
from Graham and the Pinewood mixers.

296
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:33,792
This is Bill Hope. He's a Canadian actor,
working in England at the time.

297
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:40,465
So, again, here you see her whole world
is created by a pretty simple little set

298
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,887
of a corridor and her little
efficiency apartment on the space station.

299
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,557
It's not specifically stated,
but she's never made it back to earth.

300
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:56,314
She's stayed on Gateway Station and got
a job as a dock worker, machine operator.

301
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,317
(Winston) Foreshadowing.

302
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,571
"Running loaders and forklifts."
What does that mean?

303
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:08,576
- (Hurd) I guess we'll see if we watch.
- This is exciting.

304
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,081
(Cameron) I think the intention was that...
I am a child of the '60s,

305
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,375
and the prevailing myth at that time

306
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,146
was that the Vietnam War was all about

307
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:23,758
protecting American business interests in
Asia. We wanted the evil corporation here.

308
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,554
The idea is that the corporation
has the contract

309
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:33,810
to establish colonies much in the sense
that the Dutch East India Company

310
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,729
might have controlled
that whole area of the world

311
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,817
and that colonial marines
don't work directly for them

312
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:46,614
but are called in as a security force
whenever the interests of the parent country,

313
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,743
wherever Weyland-Yutani is,
although it's probably a multinational.

314
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:56,082
Your model for that is colonial America,

315
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,087
or the Caribbean,
where the military were sent

316
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:05,842
as security for the corporations
who were bringing back the wealth

317
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,219
to the parent European countries.

318
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,514
So it's probably
a very entangled relationship.

319
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,975
The marines don't report to the company.

320
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,644
You can see there is
a separate chain of command.

321
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:22,567
They don't take orders from Burke, but Burke
makes very strong recommendations to them.

322
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,029
So they definitely have a lot of clout.

323
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,829
At the time I made the movie, I knew
diddly-dick about how big corporations work,

324
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,666
so to me they were just
this big, shadowy entity.

325
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,919
I know an awful lot more about it now.

326
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,880
And I actually nailed it,
I think, pretty close.

327
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:50,428
I think that if you look at places
of major corporate culpability,

328
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,432
like, say, the Bhopal disaster in India,
where 3,000 people were killed

329
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,937
because a major international corporation
cut corners on safety...

330
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:04,567
There's many instances throughout history
where, just by negligence,

331
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,737
corporations have been responsible
for many, many deaths,

332
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,782
but always in distant, remote places.

333
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,578
So if it's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen on a colony.

334
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,463
Obviously, this is the heart and soul of the
movie, which is Ripley's internal demon.

335
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,717
I think Sigourney's just great
in these scenes.

336
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:34,597
Interestingly, Sigourney herself
had an issue with my take on her character.

337
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,725
She didn't think that Ripley
hated the alien.

338
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,271
We had a long creative dialogue
and I said "No, she hates him."

339
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,023
She hates the alien
that killed her crew members

340
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:49,320
and put her through the most traumatic event
of her life, and wants to see them destroyed.

341
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:55,535
But I think the way I finally sold it to her
was - because Sigourney's very liberal -

342
00:24:55,703 --> 00:25:01,082
that Ripley would want to prevent the trauma
she went through happening to anybody else,

343
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,751
and she knows
there are colonists on that planet.

344
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,962
So I displaced it outside of her,

345
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,759
when in reality I saw it
as a very straightforward revenge story.

346
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:17,265
But I think that was beneficial, because
that creative tug of war between us

347
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:22,645
actually caused me to think outside
of my limited box as a writer at that time,

348
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,274
and see that her motivation
was on a higher plane as well,

349
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,402
she was acting out of a sense of duty.

350
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,572
That spoke to some of the themes
I already had in the story

351
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,116
with respect to her relationship
with Newt.

352
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,035
Once she finds out that the colony is lost

353
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,079
and that battle is lost,
she really only has one thing to fight for,

354
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,208
and that's the little
girl, the one survivor.

355
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:51,299
Her mission has been to help these people
avoid what happened to her and her crew.

356
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:04,479
(Robert) The Sulaco. This was a Syd Mead
design that was fiberglass body.

357
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:09,567
Some of the detailing
was based on that Syd Mead sketch

358
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,988
and then Pat and Dennis and myself
did a lot of the fine detailing

359
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:18,743
for the front, the side, the top,
all the microscopic detailing.

360
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:24,499
This was not a particularly large model.
It was about five or six feet long.

361
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,959
The detailing we would do after hours

362
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:32,006
because we had to be on the stage to shoot
all this stuff, get everything organized,

363
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:37,053
and once everybody went home,
we'd go up to our little effects office

364
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,932
and start another shift of microdetailing.

365
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,394
It was so cold,
we were wearing our winter coats.

366
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,980
It was hard to move around
and use these tiny little Exacto knives,

367
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,735
and these pieces of plastic that were maybe
half the size of a comma on a textbook,

368
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:57,365
sticking them on meticulously,
one after the other.

369
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,412
(Cameron) So this was our biggest set,
I guess.

370
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,248
Or the biggest volume, I guess.

371
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,085
The hanging chains,
these little widgets and things,

372
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:14,882
this was all inspired by the tone and feel
of the opening scenes of Ridley's film.

373
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,262
We were trying to create that same sense
of the ship having its own life

374
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,807
and being an eerie, interesting place.

375
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:32,233
We had a big budget cut, or we had to save
money, and the budget for this set got cut.

376
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,402
Peter Lamont came up with a great idea.

377
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,573
There's a mirror at the end of the set
and another mirror behind the camera.

378
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,910
I think we only had three
of those hypersleep capsules.

379
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:49,292
I think we might have had four. We mirrored
them out to make them into 1 2.

380
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,546
If you're clever you can see where
the mirror is but I can't see it right now.

381
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:03,097
You can see there's two Vasquezes.

382
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,227
(Winston) Another wonderful thing
about Jim and a Jim Cameron film

383
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,148
is this wonderful loyalty that he has

384
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:16,444
with people who have worked with him,
actors that have worked with him.

385
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:21,657
(Hurd) Carpenters. Bill Paxton was
a carpenter on Battle Beyond the Stars

386
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:26,704
and then one of the punks who loses his
clothes to Schwarzenegger in Terminator.

387
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:31,584
- Lance was going to be the Terminator.
- (Hurd) And then became the detective.

388
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,629
And Michael Biehn, of course.
Kyle Reese.

389
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,216
My name is Michael Biehn.
I played Hicks,

390
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:43,304
or if you've seen the DVD extended version,
that's Dwayne Hicks.

391
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,350
I'm Lance Henriksen. I played Bishop.

392
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:51,479
I'm Jenette Goldstein.
I played Private Vasquez.

393
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,232
And I'm Bill Paxton
and I played Private Hudson.

394
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,901
I just wanna say,
it's great to see you guys.

395
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:02,240
It's fun to get together every 20 years
and look at movies we were in.

396
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:07,036
- (Biehn) I'm sure they'll put that on the...
- (laughter)

397
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,831
(Paxton) Seriously,
great camaraderie making this film.

398
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,753
- (Biehn) Look at Ricco.
- (Goldstein) He's putting you all to shame.

399
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:21,717
(Paxton) I gave up early on trying
to have a physique against you guys.

400
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,305
That would have cut into my drinking time.

401
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,516
(laughter)

402
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,311
- I was doing those.
- Were you standing on a box?

403
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:36,649
- No. I'll say this once and for all.
- (Henriksen) Look at that.

404
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,153
(Biehn) Spunkmeyer.

405
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,157
(Paxton) "In the pipe. Five by five."
I always liked the way she said that.

406
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,535
(Goldstein) Actually,
those are the hard ones.

407
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,787
(Biehn) What did Mark have on there?

408
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:54,709
- I don't remember him wearing all those...
- (Paxton) Scars and bones.

409
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,170
(Goldstein) I think Jim had put
the chin-up bar up there

410
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:03,551
to make the line "Anyone ever mistaken you
for a man?" work, cos in the T-shirt

411
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:08,764
no one would have mistaken me for a man.
He said "How can we make this line work?"

412
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:13,561
So he said "Can you do
behind-the-neck chins?" I said "Yeah."

413
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:20,067
(Biehn) Is this the scene
where you guys do the thing with the knife?

414
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:24,780
I remember saying at the time
"Jim, what about...?" "Shut up, Michael."

415
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:29,327
Why did he put your hand on top of his?

416
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,956
(Henriksen) What happened was that Jim had
wanted me to do it like a demonstration.

417
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:40,171
And we got right to the moment and I said
"Jim, this is really gonna be boring."

418
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,590
I said "What if l put my hand
on Billy's hand?"

419
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,801
And since I won't hurt anybody,
I would never hurt him,

420
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,470
it would make it more interesting.

421
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:53,100
(Biehn) I never understood what Bill was so
scared of, because his hand was underneath.

422
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:58,105
(Henriksen) After the movie was done, we all
went out and partied and drank a lot of beer,

423
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,108
and I remember a voice
in the middle of the night saying

424
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,237
"You gotta come back because when
they sped up the film it looked phony."

425
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,114
Remember? We had to come back.

426
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,408
And that's when I caught
your pinky by accident.

427
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,286
Just barely touched it and he almost died.

428
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:15,831
(Paxton) I had to have
reconstructive cuticle surgery.

429
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:20,378
(Henriksen) But, anyway,
it was more interesting on his hand.

430
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:27,885
(Winston) This effect was one of the first
uses of this camera with a variable speed.

431
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,470
- (Hurd) Magic Cam?
- Yeah.

432
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,057
Which is used a lot now,
but it was a first here.

433
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,395
(Hurd) What's great about it is that
you could start out at 24 frames per second

434
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,649
and then the camera, without having to cut
and set up a separate camera,

435
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:46,320
would automatically adjust for a faster
or slower frame rate and then go back.

436
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:51,784
(Winston) Change the aperture
while it was changing its speed.

437
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,079
(Hurd) Do you remember
Lance brought over his knives?

438
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,664
(Winston) No.

439
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:01,460
(Hurd) I met Lance Henriksen at the airport
when he was coming over from the US.

440
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,214
They have much stricter
weapons laws in England.

441
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:10,219
He'd packed the knives that he'd been
practicing that effect with in his suitcase.

442
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:15,808
He said "I'm always the one
that they check to do the luggage search."

443
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,519
Going through customs
he said "Stick with me."

444
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:22,064
It was the first time
he hadn't had his luggage searched.

445
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:27,903
I thought "That's great. An actor
coming over here with concealed weapons."

446
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,998
(Cameron) Bishop, if you watch
the film again knowing the outcome,

447
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,417
he plays it completely innocent.

448
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:46,088
He plays it as this very helpful,
compassionate guy,

449
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,299
but he looks so sinister,

450
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,721
and you know enough about these synthetics from
the first film that you never believe him.

451
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,682
And the interesting thing is
he is playing it on the square

452
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,769
the entire way through the film.

453
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:06,734
So this starts off with a miniature
and pans off onto the full-size.

454
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,029
There's a foreground set piece
on the left that's a miniature.

455
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:15,075
It's another Skotak shot.
A forced-perspective shot.

456
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:22,082
I knew nothing about
the US Marine Corps at the time.

457
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,086
Although, while I was making this film,
my brother joined the marines

458
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,172
and was in for six years.

459
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,927
I now know a lot more about the marines and
they are more disciplined than these people.

460
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:38,766
I would like to apologize to any marines
listening that we did not get that part right.

461
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:43,771
These guys are definitely
Vietnam-era regular army,

462
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,774
toward the end of their tour kind of motif.

463
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,777
The film is obviously informed
by imagery from Vietnam,

464
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:54,114
the idea that they put painted flowers
on their helmets and things like that,

465
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,575
and there was a real discipline problem.

466
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,288
That was also amongst
a lot of draftees at that time.

467
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:06,293
So we're mixing our metaphors
a little bit here.

468
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:14,718
- (Biehn) Do you chew gum in every scene?
- (Paxton) I tried to.

469
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,305
If you watch my performance,
I'm always doing something.

470
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:22,476
It's all I could do in those days.

471
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,108
Everybody's archetypical in this thing.

472
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:35,614
(Biehn) I don't remember all the stuff
hanging off of Mark. Chicken bones.

473
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,034
- (Goldstein) I look like a boy.
- (Biehn) That's what we liked about you.

474
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,663
(Paxton) Was this the day, Michael,
you were passed out by the lockers

475
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,417
and Sigourney walked by
and said "There's my leading man"?

476
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,253
Am I mistaken with another day?

477
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,174
(Biehn) Somewhere around in here.

478
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:01,265
- (Henriksen) I had to audition.
- (Biehn) They made you audition for Fox.

479
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,434
(Henriksen) No, it wasn't for Fox.

480
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,396
They had a limit on how many Americans
they could bring over.

481
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,649
So they auditioned
a lot of Englishmen for that role.

482
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,861
(Hurd) The casting director,
Mary Selway, and l had to meet

483
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:18,574
every member of the North American
registry from British Actors' Equity

484
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:24,163
who was interested in being in this film
before we could bring anyone from the US.

485
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:28,876
I think we must have met
and auditioned 3,000 people.

486
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:38,010
(Cameron) I encouraged the actors to
customize their own costumes and armor,

487
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,889
to give the impression they had been
out a lot, that they were seasoned,

488
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,559
that they had been away
from command authority on their own a lot

489
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:52,399
and were good enough at their jobs that
they were allowed these kind of latitudes.

490
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,737
This is a continuation
of the motif from the first film,

491
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,699
where they're wearing Hawaiian shirts
and all kinds of strange stuff,

492
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,994
all of which was a new idea
in science fiction.

493
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:10,125
People always wore uniforms on spaceships.
That's how it worked from Star Trek on.

494
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:16,215
Every science fiction film ever made,
there was the general-issue uniform.

495
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,052
Alien broke that mold
and it just seemed so right to people.

496
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,182
They recognized the archetype instantly.
"Oh, these guys are truck drivers."

497
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,978
"They dress however they want.
There's nobody to tell them not to."

498
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:34,024
And so the idea here
was extrapolated to a military unit

499
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:39,446
that's worked at the extreme fringes
of human civilization.

500
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:44,994
The power loader was not designed
by anybody in drawings per se.

501
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,329
I had done some preliminary drawings,

502
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:52,501
but it evolved basically from trying
to figure out how to make it work.

503
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:56,964
We built full-size mock-ups
of the arms and legs in foam core.

504
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:02,845
There's a guy inside that thing,
a big, strong English stunt man moving it.

505
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:07,850
It's supported by cables.
It's completely an on-set gag.

506
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,025
The English visual effects guys thought
we were crazy the way we wanted to do it.

507
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:21,321
I said "It's the gag where the dad
lets the daughter walk on his feet,

508
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,365
his three-year-old."

509
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,285
So standing behind Sigourney right now

510
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:30,998
is this big 270-pound
body-building English stunt man.

511
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,835
He's raising the arms himself
and he has in his hands

512
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:39,006
a control that allows him
to raise the forearm of the power loader.

513
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,801
And then when they walk,
they have to walk together.

514
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,764
The weight of the machine
is held by a crane which is off-camera,

515
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,142
or some kind of overhead track rig -
we had two versions of it.

516
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:56,940
If we didn't need the machine to turn,
we mounted it on a pylon, a boom-arm thing,

517
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,028
and if we needed it to pivot
we hung it on wires.

518
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:11,371
(Winston) My kids remember all the dialogue
and one thing they did was "Bay 1 2, please."

519
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:16,460
And Newt's line:
"They're dead, all right? Can I go now?"

520
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,296
(Hurd) How about
"Get away from her, you bitch"?

521
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,673
(Winston) The most classic
line in the movie.

522
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,844
(Hurd) And obviously this was
another interesting idea that Jim had,

523
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:33,268
which was to use a Steadicam harness
that's normally used for holding a camera

524
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,814
to make a futuristic weapon out of.

525
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:42,277
Everyone said it couldn't be done, which is
at least at the beginning of Jim's career

526
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:48,450
typical of the response to Jim's ideas,
and then, of course, it worked beautifully.

527
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,375
(Winston) These were aircraft vehicles.

528
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:03,132
(Hurd) They were the tow vehicles
that were used to bring jumbo jets, 747s,

529
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:08,220
to tow them in to the Jetways
at Heathrow Airport.

530
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:16,270
And then the skin was fabricated
by metalworkers locally in Slough, England,

531
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,690
which is near Pinewood Studios.

532
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,860
(McClung) The basic framework
was an airport tug,

533
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,529
a vehicle that had four-wheel steering.

534
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,533
It weighed I don't know how many tons,

535
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,911
so they had to strip the body off
and strip a number of tons.

536
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,624
(Dennis) I think it was 72 tons.
It wound up being 28 tons when it was done.

537
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,252
(McClung) The whole thing
was full of mechanisms.

538
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,132
When they open the door, there's nothing
inside. Now we cut to an interior set piece.

539
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,511
(Robert) This interior is a cheat
because it's larger on the inside.

540
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,264
This amount of set wouldn't
have fit inside there,

541
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:57,811
but it's a movie cheat that works well.

542
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,481
(Hurd) Do you remember
when the ceiling of this collapsed?

543
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,277
I'm not sure if it was this scene
or one of the scenes later on,

544
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:11,658
but there was so much set dressing
hanging from the roof of the APC set

545
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,494
that at one point it collapsed.

546
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,878
- (Biehn) Look at Bill.
- (Paxton) This was my big speech.

547
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,505
- My big speech.
- (laughter)

548
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,345
(Paxton) God, I stayed up late
trying to learn this thing.

549
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,182
- (Biehn) You used to work hard, Bill.
- (Paxton) I worked so hard.

550
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,226
I killed myself to make it work.

551
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,230
I guess it has to do with Jim
and my relationship with Jim.

552
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,899
- (Goldstein) Your work ethic.
- That too.

553
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:50,197
But with Jim, it's peaked. You want it
right for him because he's a perfectionist

554
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,033
and you see how hard he's working.

555
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,791
(Cameron) These are all miniatures
built by Bob and Denny Skotak.

556
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,253
Fairly large miniatures.

557
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,132
When we shot this scene, Bill said "We're
on an express elevator to hell going down"

558
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,805
and the grips shook the set and the set
collapsed on us and split open my scalp.

559
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,849
So I'll always remember that line.

560
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,104
(Biehn) It caught fire and the roof came in
all on the same day.

561
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,899
(Paxton) And it hit Jim in the head.
I saw blood spurting out of his head.

562
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:31,446
It was where Sigourney was supposed to be
sitting, so it was good it hit Jim and not her.

563
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:35,033
- We'd have gotten a day off.
- (Henriksen) Think they did that on purpose?

564
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,911
- No.
- I'm just asking.

565
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,079
(laughter)

566
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,975
(Goldstein) At that point,
maybe they would've.

567
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:45,168
(Paxton) "In the pipe. Five by five."
My favorite line.

568
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:51,466
(Cameron) These shots, it's just me shaking
the back of the magazine of the camera.

569
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,344
The poor camera operator
had a bruise around his eye,

570
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,474
cos sometimes I'd whack the magazine too,
just to give it a sharp jolt.

571
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,519
This is all my shake of the camera.

572
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,897
The operator can't do it himself.

573
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,568
It just gets into this bouncy rhythm
if the operator tries to do it.

574
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,656
It has to be imposed from the outside and then
they fight it, which is the natural reflex.

575
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,494
(Winston) Such a wonderful sound design
in this movie.

576
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:25,167
(Hurd) Much of which was generated
in our living room in England.

577
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:29,212
At the time, people really
weren't using synthesizers in England

578
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,551
to create sound effects for films, and we had
a Fairlight synthesizer in our living room.

579
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,058
A lot of the sound effects were generated
by Bob Garret, Randy Frakes and Jim

580
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:46,646
in our living room near Pinewood,
including the sound of the alien queen.

581
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,191
It really was a home movie.

582
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,156
(Cameron) The dropship evolved
in its design as it went along.

583
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,492
I came in on a Sunday during preproduction

584
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,662
and bashed a kit together out of a bunch
of model parts and pieces of foam core,

585
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,874
and spray-painted it gray
and gave it to Ron Cobb to draw up.

586
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:09,836
We had brought Ron Cobb to England
to help with some of the designs.

587
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:17,719
So Ron packaged it, as he called it. He
made it look better. This is a good scene.

588
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,180
One theme of the film

589
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,684
is that these soldiers

590
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:29,523
succumb to a technologically inferior enemy
that they don't know how to fight,

591
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,025
which is really a Vietnam metaphor,

592
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:37,447
where US forces got their butts kicked
by barefoot guys running through the jungle

593
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:43,620
because they didn't understand how to fight
that war, they didn't understand their enemy.

594
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,374
So Hudson's bragging scene here
plays into that.

595
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:53,547
They're cocky. They think they can handle
anything because they've got the fire power.

596
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,926
(Winston) Bill was so wonderful in this,
such a memorable character.

597
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,096
(Hurd) And when you think
about all of this exposition

598
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:05,767
that's being delivered
in a really entertaining way.

599
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:12,232
All of this military jargon.
Because the characters are so distinctive.

600
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,153
They don't just go right past you.

601
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,084
(Cameron) We were trying to go for
a transformer effect here,

602
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,172
where it deploys these weapons pods.

603
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:44,764
More handheld rear projection
to put you there.

604
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,852
What I had noticed from a lot of science
fiction films, even the first Alien,

605
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,689
was that you've got all this handheld,
claustrophobic stuff

606
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:58,320
and then you cut to the window shots and
they're just these static cutout mattes,

607
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,740
and it violates the flow.

608
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,951
So we wanted to have
continuity across those cuts,

609
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,958
so we decided to do all the views out
the windows as rear-projection handheld.

610
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,380
This is just

611
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,383
a regular Handycam, a regular 8 Handycam,

612
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,970
whatever the standard was at that time.

613
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:28,225
(Robert) This landing
of the dropship was complicated

614
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,853
in terms of trying to hit a mark
while shooting at high speed.

615
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:36,858
The dropship was shot overcranked,
so the model had to be really moving fast

616
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,903
and those landing legs were fairly frail.

617
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:45,492
We would do take after take
and the landing legs would get crushed.

618
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,495
(Cameron) This film is
not a wide-screen film.

619
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:52,749
If I did it again, I'd shoot it wide-screen
to be consistent with the first picture.

620
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:57,003
But I didn't like anamorphic
for the visual effects problems it created.

621
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,589
I'd had a bad experience
on Escape From New York

622
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,510
trying to do anamorphic visual effects,
so we decided to shoot 1 .85.

623
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,012
I almost shot the film in Super 35,

624
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,225
but I got talked out of it by somebody
that didn't understand that format,

625
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:15,522
and then I wound up shooting
all my subsequent films in Super 35.

626
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,649
I still don't care for anamorphic.

627
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,570
You have problems with lenses shooting
miniatures, with depth of field,

628
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,613
there are problems in composite.

629
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,575
On Escape From New York
we didn't have much money

630
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,620
and we were inexperienced
in anamorphic,

631
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:35,375
so I didn't really have an alternative
that I considered viable at the time.

632
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,878
But now when I see the two pictures
back-to-back screened -

633
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,215
it doesn't make
too much difference on video -

634
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,761
I actually like the look of Alien better
because I just like the aspect ratio.

635
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:53,935
And I've come to know and love
the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

636
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:57,814
The interesting thing
is that the first film was anamorphic

637
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,317
so it used more of the negative area.

638
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,320
This is a 1 .85 picture.

639
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:10,201
In this exact year Kodak was in transition.
They were changing their emulsions.

640
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,623
This was a higher-speed negative
than had been used previously.

641
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,417
They hadn't worked out
their T-grain emulsion.

642
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,003
So it turned out grainier than I wanted.

643
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:25,467
But this was actually the standard,
just what that stock was that year.

644
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:29,471
Because we weren't using the full negative,
like with an anamorphic film,

645
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:33,683
we weren't getting
quite as much image quality.

646
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:39,606
If I had shot Super 35, it would have
looked terrible because of the graininess.

647
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:43,610
By the time I got ready to do The Abyss
a couple of years later,

648
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:47,989
they had improved the emulsions enough
that Super 35 looked pretty great.

649
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,784
I was surprised recently
at how grainy it was.

650
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,372
Nobody noticed the grain at the time
cos most films frankly looked like that.

651
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,836
(Biehn) Bill, isn't there dialogue
that you have on this

652
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,381
that people have used in video games?

653
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,259
(Paxton) Yeah, I think so.
"Game over, man" and things like that.

654
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,137
- You get anything for that?
- I don't think so.

655
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,766
I'm not even getting anything to sit here
and do this commentary.

656
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:18,311
They expect us to do it for no money.

657
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,898
(Henriksen) You got a beer out of it,
though.

658
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,650
(Paxton) No, it's just fun.

659
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,695
I got a beer out of it, so that's cool.

660
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:33,076
This was an amazing set, this concourse A.
And it was long.

661
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:37,580
And later on when all hell's breaking
loose, Jim had that little video camera.

662
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,500
He had everybody on the crew
having coffee

663
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,169
while we would run at him
and do different things.

664
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:47,507
It was so amazing to see this gigantic set,
one of the biggest sets I'd ever seen,

665
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:51,761
and there's Jim by himself
with this little camera.

666
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:56,099
(Henriksen) When did the bust-out almost
happen? He was gonna move the movie.

667
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,517
When did that happen?

668
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,770
(Paxton) I remember
there were some problems.

669
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:05,817
There were some union problems. The crew
weren't used to working the same way.

670
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:11,573
- (Biehn) With Jim.
- (Goldstein) They weren't used to working.

671
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,242
(Paxton) That's unfair.
They were craftsmen,

672
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,371
but they had an indentured way
of doing everything.

673
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:23,042
Jim needs something, he just grabs it. If he
needs a light moved, he'll grab it himself.

674
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,213
We punched a hole through somewhere
cos he needed to run a line.

675
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,800
He didn't wanna wait around.
He just said "Give me a hammer."

676
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:35,722
But this was an ambitious schedule.
Jim was running from stage to stage.

677
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,852
I think we had about three
big sound stages with giant sets.

678
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,105
And then there were two
sound stages with miniatures.

679
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,858
And then there was a stage
with all those tunnels.

680
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,527
I remember them putting you
in that damn tunnel.

681
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,237
(Henriksen) That pipe.

682
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:56,159
(Cameron) We had gone to the power station
to shoot the atmosphere-processor scenes

683
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,454
and come back to the set
after it had been wrecked.

684
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:04,250
So we're into Adrian Biddle's
photography here. He was the second DP.

685
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:11,966
I encouraged Adrian, to save time, to use
as much built-in lighting as possible.

686
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,596
This is lit by the fluorescents in the set,

687
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,807
with just a little additional lighting.

688
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:27,440
Adrian liked to work on a raw and edgy look and
work with the practical lights a lot more.

689
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,109
(Hurd) This is another thing
that is important.

690
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,279
With a lot of science fiction movies
that are all interior,

691
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:38,785
you often lose track geographically of where
you are and it becomes incredibly confusing

692
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:43,289
and it's hard to build
the tension and the suspense.

693
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:49,045
Jim was aware of this from the script stage
and made sure that we established

694
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:53,049
through the helmet cams, through the
motion trackers, where they are,

695
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:57,053
and then ultimately, later on,
where the aliens are.

696
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:01,975
(Cameron) Even in this version,
you're left to fill in what happened.

697
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,894
We don't see the battle.

698
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:11,317
We'll see plenty of battles later
and this is promising you that.

699
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,613
(Robert) We have a shot coming up here
where there were acid holes -

700
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,617
acid... holes...

701
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:26,583
eaten into the floor
by these so far unseen aliens.

702
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,919
And, of course, these sets
were not double-deck sets.

703
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:34,841
Jim wanted a scene where a character
looks down through one of these holes.

704
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:38,094
I think Bill spits down into it
to give some perspective.

705
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,389
So this down-view
we shot on our miniature stage.

706
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:45,184
We layered the set
and photographed that.

707
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,731
(Henriksen) This is where you spit
and they did it in miniature.

708
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,693
- They even did a miniature spit.
- (Goldstein) Is that what that is?

709
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,405
(McClung) To get that spitting effect,
it was actually not spit.

710
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:01,451
It didn't work very well,
so it was a combination of milk...

711
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:07,248
(Robert) Milk and water in an eyedropper
right underneath the lens.

712
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,876
(Cameron) The complaint
from the studio was that

713
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:13,212
the film went on too long
without anything really happening.

714
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,131
I was winding

715
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,008
the suspense tighter

716
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,219
before you actually saw anything.

717
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:28,387
The studio said we were just jerking
around. Too many movies that I see now,

718
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:34,233
it's all upfront. You start seeing stuff
right away and there's no sense of a build.

719
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:40,740
So this is the miniature APC
that was built by Bob and Denny Skotak.

720
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,993
Pretty good size.
I remember it being five or six feet long.

721
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,164
Most people don't twig that as a miniature.
That's the real APC pulling in.

722
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,042
They matched the lighting pretty nicely.

723
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,754
(Dennis) I think Jim did
some of his live-action stuff undercranked.

724
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,256
He ran the camera slightly slower
on the APC

725
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,426
so that it felt slightly more
as if it were a miniature

726
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:04,931
but you knew it was real because
you could see people interacting with it.

727
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,060
So if any of the miniature stuff
didn't quite work for whatever reason,

728
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:14,273
it took the curse off that cos it felt
that the two were blended together.

729
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,276
(Robert) I think he wound up undercranking

730
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:23,199
because the APC, the full-size one,
didn't move as fast as he wanted it.

731
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,370
(Dennis) I think it could only go
eight or ten miles an hour.

732
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:32,333
(Hurd) One difficult thing about making this
movie was Terminatorwasn't out in England

733
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:39,674
and the perception of Jim Cameron, who
looked about 20 when he directed this movie,

734
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:44,387
and myself as the directing-producing team
was met with a great deal of resistance

735
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:50,476
because back then the system in England
was that you had to put in years and years

736
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,730
to rise up to the level
of being a producer or a director.

737
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:59,485
And we were simply not treated
with a great deal of respect

738
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:03,614
and it was very hard
every day of the shoot.

739
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:09,495
We were being second-guessed
and every decision we made was questioned

740
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,833
and the tremendous thing, of course,
having Stan on the film was that...

741
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,794
- (Winston) I was old.
- No.

742
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:21,132
..was that you were
a cheerleader for both of us.

743
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,136
By demonstrating the respect
and enthusiasm that you did,

744
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:28,347
I think other people gradually relented.

745
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:32,727
(Winston) I knew it was the best thing
for me and for everybody on that set.

746
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:38,691
There are people that you know, no matter how
they do it, what they're doing is special.

747
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,277
This particular directing-producing team

748
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:45,865
had been a win for me in my career
and stayed that way.

749
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:52,538
(Cameron) I never thought our facehuggers
looked as good as the one in Alien.

750
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:56,209
We had to make lots of 'em
and they had to run around and do things,

751
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,545
but, texturally,
the one in the first film looked great.

752
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,758
It really held up. The bits of oysters
and stuff inside it looked great.

753
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,427
But I did wanna see the disgusting thing

754
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:10,973
that had been down the inside
of Kane's throat in the first film.

755
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:17,271
You never see it in the movie, in Alien,
so I figured we'd gross everybody out.

756
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:21,400
All of Giger's designs
have a real sexual undercurrent to them.

757
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,363
And that's what horrified people
about the alien as much as anything,

758
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:30,201
is it worked on a kind of
Freudian subconscious level.

759
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:34,705
And Ridley and Giger knew that
and they went for that.

760
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:39,460
This film was never intended to be
as much of a horror film as the first one.

761
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:43,214
It was working on
a different thematic level

762
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:50,429
but I still wanted to be true to some of
those ideas, some of those design concepts.

763
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,976
It would be natural to assume
I'd wanna work with Giger,

764
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,436
but it just didn't occur to me at the time.

765
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,732
Maybe it was because we really only needed
to design one new creature

766
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:08,990
and I had already designed her by the time
I wrote the script. The alien queen.

767
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,159
I guess maybe
it was my own ego as an artist.

768
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:16,038
I just felt like he'd made his stamp

769
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,625
and I knew from what I'd read
that he had to do everything his way

770
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,628
and I had a very specific idea
for the alien queen

771
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,715
to extrapolate beyond
what had been done before.

772
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,883
I got the impression from what l read

773
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:33,681
that I wasn't gonna get
the dynamic character that I wanted.

774
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:37,143
In a funny way, part of what
attracted me to doing this film

775
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,855
was the opportunity to do
cool design stuff.

776
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:44,817
So maybe I was just a little bit
too in love with the idea

777
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:50,489
of designing the creatures and the weapons
and doing all that stuff.

778
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:03,419
(Dennis) These shoulder-mounted lights
were not practical.

779
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:09,800
They'd go through batteries quickly and they're
delicate, but they served the purpose.

780
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:15,056
I assume at this point in the future
they'd work more efficiently.

781
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,063
(Hurd) When we were crewing up,

782
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,067
the department heads would meet with me
before they met with Jim.

783
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,569
It was a two-tier process.

784
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:34,033
A number of them came in and said
"Who's really producing this movie?"

785
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:39,205
And I'd say "I am." And they'd say
"No, you're the director's wife."

786
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,957
"You get the credit
but who's producing the movie?"

787
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:47,088
It was really difficult for me
to maintain a sense of calm.

788
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,757
(Winston) I never worked
with a better producer.

789
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:53,719
And a great directing-producing team.

790
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:58,808
Cos you're one of the few people
that actually stands up and talks to Jim.

791
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,811
There's an intimidation factor there.

792
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,356
I feel fortunate that I had
that relationship with him and you

793
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,733
for the films we've done together

794
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:13,531
but I've never worked
with a more diligent and intelligent

795
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:17,034
and, unfortunately,
tough producer as you.

796
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,246
- Thank you.
- Beat me down financially, I tell you.

797
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:24,875
"This is what we need."
"This is what you got, dude."

798
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:37,138
(Hurd) Carrie Henn, who plays Newt,
was an astonishing find.

799
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:42,101
Mary Selway, our casting director,
and her associate, Sarah Jackson,

800
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:47,064
searched throughout England and, in
fact, I think the entire British Isles,

801
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:52,153
trying to find a young girl
who could portray this character.

802
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,950
And we had every young girl
who wanted to be an actress,

803
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,787
or whose parents wanted them to act,
to come in and audition.

804
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,498
Almost all of them
had done commercials,

805
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,460
and every time
they delivered a line they would smile.

806
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,505
Of course, this is a little girl
suffering from traumatic stress.

807
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,674
She's watched her family wiped out,

808
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:18,304
every other person on
the mining colony wiped out,

809
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:23,976
and I think we probably had
500 little girls on tape.

810
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:28,522
And Carrie was found
at a US Air Force base in England.

811
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,234
Her father was a US serviceman
serving there.

812
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:38,365
And she came in and auditioned,
never having acted even in a school play,

813
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,453
and was dead on
from the very first reading.

814
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:47,416
(Winston) She's such a good little actress.
Has she done anything since this?

815
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:53,714
(Hurd) She has a normal life.
She did not pursue acting as her career.

816
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,592
One of the things
that we were very concerned about

817
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,596
was whether or not this film
would traumatize her.

818
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:06,727
It's very intense and unlike now, where
we could composite creatures in seamlessly,

819
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:11,023
or create one digitally,
she really was terrorized

820
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:17,112
by the alien warriors in the film,
and she understood it was make-believe.

821
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:25,162
Her parents were tremendously supportive
and she really had her feet on the ground.

822
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,373
This really is acting.

823
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,963
(Cameron) Carrie had never been
on a movie before,

824
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,675
but she started to enjoy it
and liked working with everybody.

825
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,718
It was a big adventure.

826
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,264
She started to become an actor.
She understood her character.

827
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:47,268
There was one day when she was sick
and they didn't want her to work.

828
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,896
She was devastated that
we were gonna do the scene with a double.

829
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,275
She pitched such a fit
that she came back.

830
01:00:54,442 --> 01:01:01,824
I wound up doing one little shot with her
so she'd feel better, so she could go home.

831
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:05,911
I worked with her a lot. I'd give her
eye lines. I'd make a mark on the wall.

832
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,498
In this scene,
she was supposed to stare off into space.

833
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:15,754
I had to unwire her from the normal response
to somebody sitting there talking to you.

834
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:20,801
So I gave her a mark on the wall to
look at, told her to blank her mind,

835
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:24,096
and that seemed to work pretty well.

836
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,937
(Carrie) This is one of
my favorite parts of the movie.

837
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,774
I guess cos Sigourney and I
had bonded so much

838
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:39,528
and this is where in the movie
our bonding does start.

839
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:44,575
She was determined
to get that dirt off of me.

840
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,745
They didn't really want her
to wipe my face clean,

841
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:52,041
and she was really determined
to get it off of me.

842
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:57,296
She didn't think it was very fair
that I was that dirty and nobody else was.

843
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,550
So it was nice that I didn't have to worry
about so much dirt later on.

844
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,721
She was really nice.
She was always helping me.

845
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:10,351
(Cameron) Sigourney and Carrie
got to be pals and they'd hang out.

846
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,646
I think Sigourney felt
very protective of her.

847
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:18,150
Sigourney didn't have
any children at that time.

848
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:23,822
There was a real bond
that was very maternal, l think, there.

849
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,576
And I think Carrie thought
Sigourney was pretty cool.

850
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:32,373
Carrie's pretty good in this scene.
She really got it.

851
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,586
(Paxton) Sigourney was so nice.

852
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:41,256
I thought I must be screwing up
cos she was so nice to me all the time,

853
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,510
but I realized she was just
really genuinely a nice person.

854
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,595
(Henriksen) She really is. Gentle.

855
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:50,307
(Paxton) She was the leader
of the cast, absolutely.

856
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,310
She took a lot of punishment in this thing.

857
01:02:53,478 --> 01:03:00,025
(Henriksen) Her back was hurting her, too.
They had to make a dummy of Newt.

858
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:04,780
- (Paxton) For her to carry.
- (Henriksen) Cos her back was killing her.

859
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,325
(Goldstein) A lot of crawling around
and crouching.

860
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:12,413
(Paxton) It's interesting to note that
she was nominated for an Academy Award

861
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:18,127
in a genre that the Academy never recognizes
- science fiction, fantasy and horror.

862
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,295
(Biehn) It does now but it didn't then.

863
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,507
(Paxton) It does now
but it certainly didn't then.

864
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,681
(Cameron) I love the idea of this little
girl who feels more secure by herself,

865
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:35,394
away from the adults, with these aliens
around, than when she's with them,

866
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,106
and the foreboding potential of that.

867
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:44,445
She looks at the marines and says "You guys are
all gonna die and I'll be on my own again,

868
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:50,075
but I'm more at risk when I'm with you
than doing my thing that I know works."

869
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,120
I really thought that was a cool idea.

870
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,001
(Henriksen) This is where I was gonna use
the two pupils in each eye.

871
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,712
And I did it and when the guy
interrupted me,

872
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,925
I turned and looked at him and Jim said
"It's so scary, I can't use it."

873
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:12,598
(Cameron) Lance loves to create a character
through some kind of physical totem.

874
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,851
In characters he's done for me,
it could be a pocket knife...

875
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,854
I'm talking about a rabbit's-foot
kind of thing.

876
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:22,357
He looks for some way
into the character.

877
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:28,822
So he, on his own, made up these
sclera lenses that had double pupils.

878
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,993
They were really creepy. It was a really
cool idea, but I felt it was too overt.

879
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:37,998
I felt it was too on the nose.
We wanted to go for an ominous thing,

880
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:42,294
but I think Lance underestimated
his own onscreen power,

881
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:46,381
and I knew that he could do
a great ominous moment.

882
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,014
(Robert) Here's a panning shot
of the armored personnel carrier.

883
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:59,186
This was done with the twelfth-scale
armored personnel carrier.

884
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:04,066
We had the camera flat on the ground and at
the beginning of the shot, behind the APC,

885
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:07,402
is the fiftieth-scale colony complex.

886
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,738
Because we're flat on the ground,

887
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:14,409
the audience doesn't see the scale
differential that's going on there.

888
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,372
Literally, the bumper of a twelfth-scale
was next to a fiftieth-scale.

889
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,167
The shots of the APC
driving into the atmosphere processor

890
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,711
were also done as miniatures.

891
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:28,674
There was no full-size entryway
that was built for the film.

892
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,843
That's why we built one as a miniature.

893
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,096
(Dennis) The sequence inside
the atmosphere processor

894
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:39,393
is a location that was
a decommissioned power station at Acton,

895
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,354
inside London or just outside of London.

896
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,731
Rather than building a set from scratch,

897
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:50,529
they used what was there
and then added the alienesque bits to it.

898
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:55,576
- (Henriksen) Look at that.
- (Goldstein) This was my first day.

899
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,203
- (Biehn) At Acton?
- First day ever on a film.

900
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:02,207
- (Biehn) You won't see me there.
- (Goldstein) Ever on any film.

901
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,252
I'd no idea what "back to one" meant
or anything.

902
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,464
(Biehn) What does it mean? 30 years later
I'm still trying to figure it out.

903
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,759
(Henriksen) That's a real gun.
That's a German Sten gun.

904
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,596
(Paxton) It was cool
until we started firing the weapons

905
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:19,808
and then this fine snow
started raining down on everybody.

906
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:24,563
- I think they checked it out.
- (Goldstein) It was just asbestos.

907
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,150
(Paxton) We had to practice
shooting flame-throwers.

908
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,486
We did the close-quarter battle stuff.

909
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:36,575
Approaching a building or going down
a hallway, you leapfrog along. We did that.

910
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:42,664
Al Matthews who plays Sergeant Apone
had some kind of military background.

911
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:47,252
I think he had served in the Vietnam War,
and after the war he had come to England,

912
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:51,048
where he'd become
a radio disc jockey, I think.

913
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:57,763
He was either really good at bullshitting us,
but he seemed to know what he was doing.

914
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:02,684
His orders were so authoritarian
that we followed him.

915
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:11,068
(Winston) Another technique that's not used
any more to create the size of that set.

916
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,946
A hanging miniature
that was the previous shot,

917
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:20,827
where you saw the expanse of the
inside of this alien virtual universe,

918
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:25,165
which is what you're seeing here,
setwise,

919
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:29,419
the cocoon aspect
of what these aliens do.

920
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,589
A hanging miniature,
which is a technique,

921
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:37,803
is a small set piece
that hangs in front of the camera

922
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:42,891
and then the full-size set is behind it
and the actors are behind it.

923
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:48,689
The illusion is that the set is huge
and expanding up and over everyone,

924
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:53,026
when, in fact, the foreground
of the set piece is a miniature,

925
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:58,490
the background of the set piece
and all the actors is normal size.

926
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:03,495
It's basically a forced-perspective shot.

927
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,250
(Paxton) This is my first
on-camera line coming up.

928
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,127
(Goldstein) This was the first day.

929
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:14,965
(Paxton) We started at Acton.
We started here.

930
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:18,051
(Biehn) I thought you guys
had already been shooting.

931
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,389
- (Goldstein) They had to reshoot.
- (Paxton) We went back and picked up here.

932
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,599
(Biehn) I see.

933
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,230
(Paxton) And Dick Bush,
the cinematographer,

934
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:33,567
was replaced by Adrian Biddle

935
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:37,571
somewhere in this area at the same time.

936
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:42,534
A few changes were made in the lineup
about two weeks in.

937
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:51,209
(Robert)
I heard that some of the studio execs

938
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,628
were screening footage
back in the States,

939
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:59,926
and they were a little perturbed and asking
"Where's the effects shot?"

940
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:05,223
Gale Hurd said
"You just saw an effects shot."

941
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,225
She was referring
to that perspective shot.

942
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:11,271
They were completely fooled by it.
They thought nothing had been shot.

943
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:17,194
(Dennis) They thought they were spending
huge amounts of money on these sets.

944
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,822
(Robert) They said "You spent so much
and there's no miniature."

945
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,075
She said "No, that is the miniature."

946
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,203
(McClung)
It was a smart move on Cameron's part,

947
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,498
to do it that way very quickly in the film,

948
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,542
so the studio wasn't worried
quite as much

949
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,129
about what was going on
5,000 miles away in London.

950
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,424
(Dennis) It does make it
a bit tricky to shoot, though.

951
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:44,513
If anything goes wrong, you're stuck with it or
you have to fix it later but with a reshoot.

952
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,598
You can't really fix it later.

953
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,892
So that worked out quite well,

954
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,271
but with actors and everything
there's a lot on the line.

955
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:59,486
(Robert) Something we've lost sight of over the
years is that with this era of filmmaking,

956
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:03,198
not only for live-action
but for miniatures,

957
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:06,159
there wasn't much ability
to go back and fix something.

958
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:10,872
Now, digitally, you can change
an actor's face, you can get rid of wires,

959
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:16,545
do all kinds of tricks, split-screen,
take elements and change shots.

960
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:22,759
But at that time you had to plan these things
and make it work within a narrow tolerance,

961
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:27,013
otherwise that was it,
that's what wound up in the film.

962
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:31,059
(Dennis) It reminds me of a stage play.
You're doing it live, in a sense.

963
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:37,858
What was on film was it. There was no going
back. You could only do it so many times.

964
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:44,865
There was a limited budget to work with
and it had to work on film, no matter what.

965
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,704
(Winston) My crew actually helped
dress this whole set

966
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:54,499
because it had to be cocooned bodies,

967
01:10:54,667 --> 01:11:00,046
and so we created all these bodies
and all the dressing over it,

968
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,591
to help out the art department.

969
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:07,262
(Hurd) I remember being terrified
that the set wouldn't be ready in time.

970
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,890
Because it was very complicated.

971
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,851
(Winston) Everybody had to pitch in
and make the movie work.

972
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,938
It was a lot to do in a
short period of time.

973
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:23,111
No one else would have
really been able to do it, even this stuff.

974
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,155
(Hurd) I even doubled for Vasquez.

975
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,782
(Winston) Did you?
Do you remember the shot?

976
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:32,537
(Hurd) Of course I remember the shot.
I'll show you later on.

977
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,751
(Winston) Our homage to what
everyone needs to see

978
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,212
in this movie is about to come up.

979
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,550
This was a very tough scene to create,
which was the chestburster scene.

980
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:50,263
Again, a duplication of
head and entire body

981
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:57,729
and then we built an entire puppet of her
for the chestburster and the burn sequence.

982
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,237
(Cameron) James Horner
came up with this music sting here

983
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:09,199
and I always thought
it was totally over the top.

984
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,788
When I saw the whole film put together
with the score,

985
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:17,374
I thought "No, that's what we need."

986
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:23,255
I thought "How can you sting somebody
opening their eyes?" But it works.

987
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,176
(Paxton) Oh! Mm-hm.

988
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,638
She shouldn't have had
the bangers and mash.

989
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,769
Kill it. Fry it. Come on.
What are you doing, Hicks?

990
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,772
(Biehn) Bad-ass nasty shot.

991
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,151
That's a nasty shot of that thing.

992
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,531
(Paxton) That's a good shot
of it there getting fried.

993
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,866
Gosh.

994
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,660
Here they come.

995
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:58,373
(Cameron) I think our chestburster looks a
little cooler than the one in the first film.

996
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,376
Stan Winston's guys
really did a good job on it.

997
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,462
John Rosengrant and Shane Mahan.

998
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,425
(Hurd) Look who's back.

999
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:12,971
(Winston) Another one of our problems
to solve for this movie

1000
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:19,394
was creating the whole army of warrior aliens
and being legitimate to the original movie

1001
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:26,693
but having to improve on it for movement and
for the look of being able to study them.

1002
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,529
In the original Alien
they were rubber suits

1003
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:32,490
and very difficult
for the actor to move around in.

1004
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,493
(Hurd) And yet he was
very tall and very skinny.

1005
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:41,916
(Winston) And Jim wanted to do a lot of very
interesting moves with the warrior aliens,

1006
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:45,378
so we came up with a technique
to create the suit

1007
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:49,466
that really involved
a lot of spandex and pieces on it.

1008
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:54,471
And then we designed the set pieces
for the aliens to fit into the walls,

1009
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:59,768
like the one that is behind him there,
so that the camouflage would work.

1010
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:04,189
An enormous amount of wirework
for all of these stunt alien performers,

1011
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:10,236
which required that the alien costumes
be extremely user-friendly.

1012
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,323
(Cameron) This was inspired
by the scene in the first film

1013
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:18,453
where Dallas is in the air vents and they see
the signal moving and get a little freaked,

1014
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,040
and Veronica Cartwright says
"Get outta there"

1015
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,918
and he makes the wrong move
and gets killed.

1016
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,129
That's one of the most
suspenseful scenes in the first film.

1017
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:32,634
I took that idea that they're getting these
readings that are getting them spooked

1018
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,720
and then they make some bad moves.

1019
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,309
(Hurd) Form follows function.
This is a perfect example of it.

1020
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:47,565
You start with what it is you wanna achieve,
and once you have that, you can design it,

1021
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:52,404
so the actions and the performance

1022
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,907
is consistent with
what you want in the finished film.

1023
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,993
Believe it or not,
very few people work that way.

1024
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,996
They just wanna come up
with something that's cool,

1025
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:07,836
and then you spend hours and hours trying
to get it to work for the ultimate film.

1026
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:12,424
(Winston) I happen to agree with Gale.
My background is as an actor.

1027
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,176
I really come from a place

1028
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:19,431
where the creatures and the characters
are wonderful to look at,

1029
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,891
but it's always about their performance.

1030
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:25,478
We have to figure out
how they're gonna be able to act,

1031
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,773
and create a good performance,
or it's a waste.

1032
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,026
And so that's really always at the top

1033
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,613
of the priority list
when we're creating any creature -

1034
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,908
what is it gonna do
and how is it gonna do it?

1035
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:44,789
(Hurd) What he does is create a character, and
that's why I think his work is so unique.

1036
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:50,378
When you look at a film, you can always
tell who's done the creatures,

1037
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,547
if they actually have a character.

1038
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:57,552
Because he creates a character
that can act and perform.

1039
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,139
(Cameron) The whole film
builds to this moment,

1040
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:04,726
where the power transfers
from the authoritarian structure

1041
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,895
to the individual who takes action.

1042
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:12,817
Ripley's not supposed to do anything.
She's just there as an observer.

1043
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:18,198
(Robert) We're coming up to a sequence
where Sigourney takes control of the APC

1044
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:22,744
and this sequence is comprised
of live-action shots,

1045
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:27,874
but as it comes down this hallway and is
banging into pipes and walls and sparking,

1046
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,376
that's all done in miniature.

1047
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:35,590
In some cases, the cameraman -
cos the set was mounted at an angle -

1048
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,092
was on a cart, a wheeled cart,

1049
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:44,974
and was rolling backwards as the
radio-controlled APC was coming at camera.

1050
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:50,271
There was a point when he was just put
into free fall, rolling backwards downhill,

1051
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:55,360
photographing what was in front of him
as he went backwards.

1052
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,906
- (Winston) Here we go.
- (Hurd) This is the shot.

1053
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,450
(Winston) This is also miniatures.

1054
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,746
(Hurd) There was a shot with the full-size
when the brakes didn't work,

1055
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:10,583
and took out the camera, and luckily
it was a remote-operated camera.

1056
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:16,381
(Winston) It was the shot where
we were actually crushing an alien warrior,

1057
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,883
when it broke through.

1058
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,596
This is the shot, actually,
when it took the camera out.

1059
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:27,809
Then there's another shot
where it takes down an alien.

1060
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:36,985
(Cameron) These shots of the aliens hanging
from the ceiling are just shot upside down.

1061
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:41,281
It's just guys standing there
in an alien suit.

1062
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:45,201
And we set up some alien puppets
made out of foam

1063
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:50,331
and filled them with gak and guts
and yellow goo,

1064
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,418
and blew the hell out of them, as I recall.

1065
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,587
Made a big mess.

1066
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,049
(Winston) Miniscule things we had to do,

1067
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:04,554
like creating burn appliance make-up
for when the acid would hit.

1068
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,098
Here's a case right here.

1069
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:11,352
Alien comes up, splats,

1070
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,938
and the blood is right here.

1071
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:19,360
- (Hurd) Quick cut.
- (Winston) Quick cut. But prosthetics used.

1072
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:23,031
(McClung) John Richardson
was the physical effects supervisor.

1073
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,577
I was at his shop on the lot, and they were
testing one of these flame-throwers

1074
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,247
and it was a real flame-thrower
that they had built.

1075
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,208
This thing would go about 20 or 30 feet.

1076
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:41,007
So every time you see flames coming out,
it's the real thing. It was a little scary.

1077
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:46,721
(Cameron) When we did the fire in the APC,
there was something used to age the set,

1078
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:50,808
some kind of wax-based substance
that the art department had dabbed on

1079
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:55,855
to make the set look more like
a used military vehicle.

1080
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,691
And the heat caused it to vaporize

1081
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:02,654
and the actors got this strong sense
that they couldn't breathe.

1082
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,365
It caused their throats to close up.

1083
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:09,827
Bill tells the story
Jenette is going "Ugh!"

1084
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:14,499
And Bill remembers thinking
"She's coming up with some great stuff."

1085
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,626
And she really couldn't breathe.

1086
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:20,171
I don't remember what we did.
Probably just kept shooting.

1087
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:24,300
I think we just kept the fire
out of the inside, kept going.

1088
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:30,306
(McClung) Because the full-size APC
was incapable of spinning its wheels,

1089
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,350
all those shots of Ripley

1090
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:36,604
when she hits the gas and you see the wheels
spin and smoke are all the miniature,

1091
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:42,276
because the full-size vehicle again
weighed some 20 or 30 tons.

1092
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:48,783
(Robert) We had put A-B smoke... A
solution on the wheel and B on the ground.

1093
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:53,663
And as the tire turned, it would mix
that A and B together and give the smoke.

1094
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:57,333
We had somebody holding back
the front of the APC for a moment,

1095
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:00,545
so that the tire'd spin,
then we'd let it go.

1096
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:06,467
(McClung) That A-B smoke is really toxic.
We don't like to breathe that stuff.

1097
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,557
(Cameron) We had different kinds of smoke.

1098
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:17,061
We had some really nasty smoke
that I think is illegal to use now,

1099
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:22,400
titanium tetroxide stuff that created
that really nice coherent smoke,

1100
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,445
but that was only used
for some of the alien acid stuff.

1101
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:30,074
And then you just used a regular mole fogger.
We used A-B smoke for a couple of things.

1102
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:35,913
Some of the acid hits were done
with A-B smoke, which is pretty caustic.

1103
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:42,962
(Biehn) In Jim's movies - I think of it
the same way with The Terminator -

1104
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,926
there's not one shot in it that you go
"That's bad" or "That doesn't work."

1105
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,304
It just seems like every single shot...

1106
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:55,308
(Paxton) He knows how to put all the shots

1107
01:20:55,476 --> 01:21:02,106
that really make the whole sequence
snap, crackle and pop, that's for sure.

1108
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:06,235
There's not many directors
who are fluent in the language of film.

1109
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:10,490
Jim comes to it intuitively.

1110
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:18,623
- (Biehn) What are you crying about here?
- (Paxton) Something.

1111
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:25,254
(Biehn) Somebody was always
telling you to relax.

1112
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:31,260
(Paxton) It was a character where I felt the
audience is gonna be so ready for him to die.

1113
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,763
(Biehn) You got
a good death scene, though.

1114
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:39,560
(Carrie) This was weird at first cos I wasn't
quite used to all the cussing around me.

1115
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,021
Hudson tended to say a lot.

1116
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:45,858
Every time when we'd cut,
he'd look at me - "I'm so sorry."

1117
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:50,154
I didn't care,
but I kind of felt bad for him.

1118
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:56,911
And at this time, you never really realize
what a bad guy Paul Reiser was.

1119
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:02,208
(Winston) Paul was so good in this.
You so wanted him to get killed.

1120
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,420
(Hurd) I love that in a villain. Hudson,
the character that Bill Paxton plays,

1121
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,048
is the voice of the audience in this.

1122
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,801
He's saying the things
the audience would say

1123
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:14,846
and asking the questions
the audience would ask.

1124
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:24,063
(Cameron) You could tell
when we started screening the film...

1125
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:29,110
We didn't screen it in the way they do now.
We never did a test screening.

1126
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:34,198
But at the premiere, let's say, which is the
first time I saw the film with an audience,

1127
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,534
which is unthinkable these days,

1128
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:40,079
we could tell the audience
really liked Hudson, really connected.

1129
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:43,124
I like this scene cos, again,
it's the transfer of power.

1130
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:47,461
Sigourney has made Burke
as a guy she can't trust.

1131
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:51,757
Ripley has figured out Burke's agenda,

1132
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,386
and she's created
enough of a bond with Hicks

1133
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,931
that she knows she can get him
to do what needs to be done,

1134
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,475
take command
even though he's a corporal.

1135
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,437
(McClung) Having been in the army
myself in the '70s,

1136
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:09,901
Jim really nailed army life for the
military, and he was never in the military.

1137
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:12,862
- (Dennis) Jim wasn't.
- That's how guys acted.

1138
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:24,290
(Dennis) Rear projection is an older technique
that's been used in a lot of films.

1139
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,584
It's basically having a projector

1140
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:30,630
a distance away from a translucent screen
that's behind the actor.

1141
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:35,176
The image of the scene they're supposed
to be standing in front of is projected -

1142
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:41,057
previously shot footage - and that method
tends to look like what you're doing,

1143
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:44,518
unless, as Jim shoots it,
the camera's moving a lot

1144
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:50,524
and there's a lot of things
to obscure the straight photography of it.

1145
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:55,821
Front projection uses a material that
is made by 3M and some other companies

1146
01:23:55,989 --> 01:24:01,077
that is related to the material
used for traffic signs.

1147
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:04,372
When your headlights hit the signs,
they kind of glow back.

1148
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,584
It's very similar to that, except
it's an even more extreme version of it.

1149
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,336
An image is projected...

1150
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,589
(Robert) From the camera
rather than behind the set.

1151
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:17,301
(Dennis) It's projected
from near the camera,

1152
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:21,055
hits the screen and it comes
right back at the camera.

1153
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,808
The shadow that you would expect to see

1154
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:28,729
is hidden by the object or person in the
foreground. It's self-hiding, in theory.

1155
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:34,068
(Robert) Front projection produces
a more photographable image.

1156
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:40,324
It retains the illumination level
better than rear projection.

1157
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,327
We did a number
of these dropship crashes,

1158
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:46,872
four or five of these things
to finally get the plate right.

1159
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,251
(Dennis) Jim was specific about
how the dropship would hit.

1160
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,879
This whole ballet of it
rolling and so forth.

1161
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:58,843
(Robert) We had to design that in
so that the pods hit a certain way,

1162
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:03,347
the landing leg shears off by hitting a rock
which sends it skewing slightly sideways

1163
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:07,101
which dovetails into
this tumbling action.

1164
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:11,188
This has become
a famous shot in the film.

1165
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:17,737
(Cameron) Every film is a snapshot
of the technical capabilities of its time.

1166
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:22,533
Even though at the time you feel like
you're moving things forward a little bit,

1167
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:28,205
you look back on it now, 1 8 years later,
and it just seems quaint.

1168
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:32,626
(Carrie) This is one of the scenes
I don't particularly like.

1169
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,880
There's a line in here
and it seems to be the only line of mine

1170
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,674
that everybody I ever run into remembers.

1171
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:43,596
Anyone who ever wants to irritate me,
any of my friends, they just say this.

1172
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:49,560
They say it with everything. The line was
"They mostly come out at night. Mostly."

1173
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:53,397
My friends'll be like "We mostly
go to the movies at night. Mostly."

1174
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,525
They come up with whatever
they can possibly come up with.

1175
01:25:56,693 --> 01:26:03,616
It's probably the one scene l don't really
particularly like in the whole thing.

1176
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,498
(Robert) This shot with Ripley and Newt

1177
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:15,920
looking back at the burning,
damaged atmosphere processor

1178
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:21,133
was done with doubles
months after live action had wrapped.

1179
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,222
(Henriksen) I never realized
I had such a small part in this.

1180
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,432
(laughter)

1181
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,606
(Biehn) You come in big
at the end, though.

1182
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,316
(Cameron) A typical group scene.

1183
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:41,320
My challenge was almost every scene
was a group scene.

1184
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:46,117
Most scenes had seven,
eight characters at one time,

1185
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:49,745
so there were a lot of camera axes.

1186
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,665
In Terminator every scene
had two or three people in it.

1187
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,625
It was no problem.

1188
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:57,795
But almost every scene in this
had multiple characters,

1189
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:01,465
a Gatling gun of dialogue
going around the room,

1190
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:07,388
and I found that challenging at first
till I got it all straight in my head.

1191
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,307
I wasn't that experienced.

1192
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:14,478
This was my second film.

1193
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:19,984
- (Paxton) I wanted to be cool like Michael.
- (Biehn) I was cool in that shot.

1194
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,362
(Paxton) I wanted to be the cool guy,
not the guy bellyaching.

1195
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:28,033
- (Biehn) This movie made you a star.
- I wanted to be Michael Biehn in this movie.

1196
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:32,246
- (Biehn) So did l.
- (Henriksen) I wanted to be Sigourney.

1197
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,248
(laughter)

1198
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:41,297
- (Paxton) "Why don't you put her in charge?"
- (laughter)

1199
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:45,384
(Henriksen) There it is.
That's a classic, man.

1200
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,180
(Cameron) Actor dynamics are tricky,

1201
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,349
cos actors are all gonna peak
at different moments,

1202
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:56,770
and it's impossible
not to go through a power hierarchy.

1203
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,065
The group always knows
who's getting the close-up.

1204
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:04,528
There's this sense that I should do a close-up
on everybody so nobody feels left out.

1205
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:09,742
There's a whole political side to doing a
group scene. They all see what's going on.

1206
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:13,579
Eventually I dispensed with that
and went for Sigourney's close-up.

1207
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:17,291
Fortunately, Sigourney always
liked to go last, which was good.

1208
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:21,170
She liked to build and have the time
before the camera got in tight on her

1209
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:24,340
to really pick
how she was gonna do her moments.

1210
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:27,092
(Henriksen) Here goes. "I'll do it.
I'll go."

1211
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,054
"Send the doll."
That's what Bill's whole thing was.

1212
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,098
- (Biehn) Send the doll?
- (Henriksen) "Send the doll out there, man."

1213
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,434
I was so hurt.

1214
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,938
(Paxton) Yeah, man. Hudson should go.
I mean Bishop should go.

1215
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:42,399
(Henriksen) There's a pipe.
Send him down the pipe.

1216
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:47,196
My favorite thing was Bill wanted
to use me as a training toy.

1217
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:50,908
"Let's chase Bishop around
and shoot at him."

1218
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:54,245
(Paxton) The processing station.

1219
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:57,998
(Biehn) You were so into your character,
we'd ask you for a coffee,

1220
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:02,419
you'd run for it, go clean up our trailers.

1221
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:10,469
(Henriksen) I was absolutely selfless.
That was embarrassing, man.

1222
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:26,110
(Cameron) I never liked that shot because
she keeps pointing at the same spot.

1223
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,905
I think that was a second-unit shot

1224
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:33,951
that was done while I was in another room
shooting something else.

1225
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,662
I was never happy with it.

1226
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:41,417
The whole idea was she's supposed to be
showing the whole area.

1227
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:44,712
The floor diagram
didn't resemble the set either.

1228
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,756
You gotta remember,
this is a low-budget film.

1229
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:50,301
Got to cut it a little slack.

1230
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:59,393
I like these really
advanced laptops they have.

1231
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:02,813
We thought we were
being so advanced here.

1232
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:08,152
This is an added scene
with these sentry guns.

1233
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:13,532
This is a scene that got the ax
as a result of the studio's idea

1234
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:18,245
that we were wasting too much time
not really getting on with the story.

1235
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:24,918
I actually think this stuff really ups
the ante and increases the fear a lot.

1236
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:40,059
(Hurd) Because The Terminator hadn't come
out yet, there was the perception that Jim

1237
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:44,772
was somehow not up to
the creative responsibility

1238
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:49,109
of directing a sequel
to Ridley Scott's masterpiece.

1239
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,278
There was a lot of resentment,

1240
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:58,535
and really no understanding, or very little,
of what he was trying to accomplish.

1241
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:01,580
We had people who were, I think,
completely on our side -

1242
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:08,212
John Richardson in practical special
effects, Brian Johnson in visual effects.

1243
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,715
There were people
who understood Jim's vision,

1244
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:15,928
but there were quite a few people
who simply looked at him

1245
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:23,227
as the know-nothing, upstart Yank, which drove
Jim crazy, considering he's a Canadian.

1246
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:27,981
(Winston) It was his right hand, his AD.

1247
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:32,528
(Hurd) The leader of the rebellion,
the first assistant director,

1248
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:38,492
not only behind Jim's back but to his face
would call him "Guv'nor" and roll his eyes,

1249
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,745
as if Jim hadn't earned the title yet.

1250
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:46,917
We were shooting very long hours
and people were pretty frazzled,

1251
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:52,756
and by our standards in America at the time a
12-hour day is not a long day, it's average,

1252
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:56,552
but 1 2 hours at the time in England
was a very long day,

1253
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,472
and there were times
when we'd go into a 14-hour day.

1254
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:06,311
At a certain point
our assistant director, basically, said:

1255
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,606
"We're not doing this any more."

1256
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:14,945
So we fired him. And he felt that
he really should be directing the movie.

1257
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:18,907
He was a frustrated director.
He had directed second unit before.

1258
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:22,411
I think he even had directed a small film.

1259
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:26,874
But he really felt that he was better
qualified than Jim was to direct the film.

1260
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:33,213
He went to all the departments
and some cast members

1261
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,550
and everyone walked off the set.

1262
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:39,845
It was the most difficult moment

1263
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:42,639
of my entire career, even to this day,

1264
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,309
trying to rally everyone back.

1265
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:51,106
In fact, we were able to turn it around
so that the outcome of that mutiny

1266
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,818
was that we were united,
after we resolved the issues,

1267
01:32:54,986 --> 01:33:00,657
for the first time on the film and going
onto the rest of the production schedule.

1268
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,577
We actually were a unified group.

1269
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:10,042
So it was an example of something good
coming out of a really difficult situation.

1270
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:14,296
(Winston) I remember talking to people

1271
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:17,007
and going "This is a wonderful movie."

1272
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,971
And hoping that
no one would lose the energy.

1273
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:27,684
Fortunately, because of how you handled it,
it all came together.

1274
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,562
Because it was scary. It was very scary.

1275
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,399
We were at that point -
what are we gonna do, hire a new crew?

1276
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:39,863
(Hurd) Not that the thought didn't cross
my mind, but England was very busy.

1277
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:44,576
We didn't have the option. There weren't
other key crew members even available.

1278
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:48,622
When you have no options,
you make it work, and we did.

1279
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,875
(Winston) This is probably
my favorite movie of my career,

1280
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:57,965
and the only movie where I've experienced
anything like what we went through.

1281
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:01,093
I will also say, on the positive side,
of the English crew...

1282
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:04,179
I brought a handful of guys
from the States.

1283
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:08,392
We started all our designs
and our builds in the States

1284
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,896
and then built a workshop in Pinewood

1285
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:20,904
and hired all but a half a dozen of the key
coordinators from my studio from England.

1286
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,907
And everybody worked very hard
and did a great job.

1287
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:29,037
They were wonderful artists and committed
and everybody wanted to do a good job.

1288
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:32,499
They just had slightly different
work habits than we did.

1289
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:37,296
I was shocked when suddenly,
at a particular time mid-morning,

1290
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:42,426
everybody would be gone. I'd go "Where
is everybody?" They'd go "They're at tea."

1291
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:45,721
I said "Hello?" Just gone.

1292
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,973
(Hurd) The other thing
is that Pinewood Studios

1293
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:51,351
at the time had an entire crew on staff

1294
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,937
that were assigned to a movie.

1295
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:58,567
Right now it's four-wall, which means
you hire the crew you want, it's freelance.

1296
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:04,448
But you ended up with the crew that was
assigned to the stages you were working on

1297
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:07,618
and there was no
selection process involved.

1298
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:13,540
It made it really difficult because
some people really were punching a clock.

1299
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,792
They didn't want overtime,

1300
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:22,174
didn't wanna do anything
other than work an eight-hour day.

1301
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:28,472
(Cameron) Shooting this film in England
wasn't just a culture clash.

1302
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:35,979
For me, it was also a transition from
a non-union guerilla-filmmaking mentality,

1303
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:41,818
which started at Roger Corman's New World
Pictures and continued on The Terminator,

1304
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:47,658
which had a non-union crew,
to a union picture.

1305
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:52,996
And also the particular way that they work
in England was very, very different,

1306
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,999
and so there was an adaptation to that.

1307
01:35:56,167 --> 01:36:00,003
And, frankly, l thought there were
a lot of people on the crew that were,

1308
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:05,884
to use a charitable term, comfortable,
and that was completely foreign to me.

1309
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:12,516
I'd been used to working with young,
eager, hard-core, dedicated film folks.

1310
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,726
They all had something to prove.

1311
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:20,732
But a lot of the people especially at the
Pinewood Studios at that time were lifers.

1312
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:26,029
They had permanent employment. It didn't
matter what movie they were working on.

1313
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:30,867
And they got pushed on us. If you did
Pinewood, you had to use their people.

1314
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:35,205
It was a whole different mentality. So I
pushed against that as hard as I could.

1315
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:37,916
If I hadn't, we wouldn't
have got the film done

1316
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,919
on budget and on schedule,
which we did.

1317
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:45,549
I know probably a lot of people there
at Pinewood at the time didn't care for us,

1318
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:49,761
with our guerilla-filmmaking
ways and styles - we were not polite.

1319
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:53,557
By the end there were a number of them
that came to respect the fact

1320
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:58,770
at least that we knew what we were doing,
which I guess is OK.

1321
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,151
(Hurd) The other aspect that was a shock

1322
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:07,654
to those of us who came from
really indie filmmaking -

1323
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,991
I started with Roger Corman,
you can't get any more indie -

1324
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:15,579
is that everyone in their family
had done the same job.

1325
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:17,914
This is not, obviously, across the board.

1326
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:21,585
There wasn't the enthusiasm -
"Let's get together and do a movie" -

1327
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:25,130
we were used to.

1328
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:29,634
I think their craftsmanship
was as fine if not even more spectacular

1329
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,220
than anything I've seen before or since.

1330
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,931
And they did take complete pride in that,

1331
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,935
but it really is a different approach
to working.

1332
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:42,564
(Winston) Once you're aware
of the difference in work habit,

1333
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,024
you can adjust to it.

1334
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,610
You know you've gotta get
the product done.

1335
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:50,655
Everybody wants the same thing.
They just approach it in a different way.

1336
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:53,617
That's all part of our learning curve.

1337
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:57,370
(Hurd) Now it's different also
because there are not people on staff

1338
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,498
that are assigned to your movie.

1339
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:06,630
And also the liquid alcohol-based lunch
is not the same any more.

1340
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:11,551
(Cameron) When you take time out,
you do a bit of everything.

1341
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,304
You trim shots,
you take out a second here and there.

1342
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:21,311
At this time we weren't cutting on the Avid
yet or any nonlinear digital editing system,

1343
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:27,484
so there was less of a tendency
to nickel-and-dime tiny cuts of 1 0 frames.

1344
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:31,279
Cutting on a Moviola, every cut
had to be a splice that was opened up,

1345
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:35,450
so you tended to make lifts
which were full scenes or partial scenes.

1346
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:40,580
When I cut Titanic,
I made all the lifts I could

1347
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:46,670
and I was still miles out, so I went
through cutting 1 0 frames here and there

1348
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,381
and got out another five minutes.

1349
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:51,675
This is rear projection.

1350
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:59,432
For the visual effects on this film, we needed
all these process plates, projection plates,

1351
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,812
so the model unit
had to be scrambled well ahead of time,

1352
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:08,441
actually producing finished shots
in a way that we could project on the set.

1353
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:11,736
We knew we wanted a specific look
out of all of these windows.

1354
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:15,574
We wanted to be able to have moisture
on the window and dust and wind

1355
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:18,743
and all these sorts of things
that would degrade the image,

1356
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:22,038
so we wanted to have
these projections done in advance.

1357
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:40,223
I like the feeling of these guys
just working the problem,

1358
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:42,893
just trying to figure it out.

1359
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:48,440
There's always a moment when
there's the thing you know you need to do

1360
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:52,235
and Bishop just steps up and volunteers.

1361
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:57,240
If you're claustrophobic, this is something
you don't wanna try at home,

1362
01:39:57,408 --> 01:40:01,745
get yourself welded into a pipe
that's no wider than your shoulders.

1363
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:04,623
When I was a kid,
we had a contest in my neighborhood.

1364
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:08,460
They were always building
new subdivisions.

1365
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:13,757
We used to see who could crawl the furthest
though the water pipes that had been laid.

1366
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:15,842
I won because I have no claustrophobia,

1367
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,471
but I got stuck once
about 1 00m into a water pipe.

1368
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:22,015
Had to back out.

1369
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:25,310
That's a little moment from my childhood.

1370
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:29,147
Lance does a curious thing
at the end of that close-up.

1371
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:33,526
I said "What was that?" He said
"Bishop just realized he made a joke."

1372
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:37,989
You can actually see that, if you know that's
what's in his head and you watch that shot.

1373
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,825
Bishop realizes after the fact
that he made a joke.

1374
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:44,496
Because he's not human,
he doesn't know if it worked or not.

1375
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:51,211
(Paxton) This was too freaky, I gotta tell you.
I wouldn't have been able to do this, Lance.

1376
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:55,548
- How did you get in there in the first place?
- (Henriksen) Look how you get in.

1377
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,175
(Goldstein) You just crawl in.

1378
01:40:57,343 --> 01:41:01,638
(Henriksen) You lower yourself in
and then twist around.

1379
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,432
(Biehn) It's the shot of you
putting the lid on.

1380
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:09,229
"Don't hurt your finger." That's the thing
you say here, right? That defines him.

1381
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:12,941
(Paxton) You found stuff like that.
You found it from your character.

1382
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:17,237
He was always trying to be of service,
like the gas company.

1383
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,489
- (Henriksen) Look at this shot.
- This is it.

1384
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:24,703
(Henriksen) They dragged a camera
on wheels in front of me.

1385
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,831
- (Biehn) Is that how they did it?
- Yeah.

1386
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,124
With a rope?

1387
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,011
(Paxton) I remember watching you
shoot that.

1388
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:35,964
I think you were on another stage. They had
that pipe. I remember watching you do that.

1389
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:39,884
(Henriksen) I never let them
light me that way any more.

1390
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:41,970
It's pretty rough.

1391
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:49,561
(Cameron) I think editorially
it's a fun moment. I like the build.

1392
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:53,523
I didn't do any editing directly
on this film.

1393
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:58,778
Because it's film-based editing, with rapid
cutting, I thought it had really good energy.

1394
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:05,368
You see that cutting now with the Avid cos
you don't have to make each splice manually.

1395
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:08,663
This is the Alamo told with six people.

1396
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:12,959
So the sentry guns are the equivalent
of the first couple of attacks.

1397
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:17,380
I think it's great foreboding.
It's just coming at them like a wave.

1398
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:20,008
If these guns don't stop them,
they're screwed.

1399
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:24,471
I think it works pretty well, but the
studio talked me into taking it out.

1400
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:29,726
So I'm happy to see it restored
in this extended version.

1401
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:35,398
(Hurd) Ray Lovejoy was our editor
and it was a tremendous responsibility.

1402
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:40,820
And this is before you had
all of the Avid and Lightworks

1403
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,406
and any kind of digital editing.

1404
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:49,412
There was so much film and we had
a pretty short postproduction schedule

1405
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:52,749
and he did just a tremendous job.

1406
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:57,337
(Cameron) I hired Ray for one simple reason
- cos he had worked with Stanley Kubrick.

1407
01:42:57,505 --> 01:43:01,508
It took him a while to really get
what I was trying to do with this movie.

1408
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:04,928
A lot of his early cuts
I didn't really care for.

1409
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:09,015
It's not that there was ever
any tension between us.

1410
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,810
I just didn't feel l was
getting what I wanted.

1411
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:17,982
Ray was getting really frustrated. I remember
toward the end he cut the alien queen battle,

1412
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:20,230
the power loader queen battle
at the end of the film.

1413
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:25,573
He was really nervous, cos he hadn't
given me the action cutting that I wanted

1414
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,325
and I'd had to mess with it a lot

1415
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,328
and there was another editor
who was cutting some stuff,

1416
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:34,290
and I was liking his action cutting
better than Ray's.

1417
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:38,586
Ray is just a dear guy and a really
good editor, but he was struggling with it.

1418
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:41,589
So, finally, he just grabbed all the film,

1419
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:44,300
locked himself in his room,
said "Don't bother me."

1420
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:47,470
Not mean or anything,
but "I just gotta do this."

1421
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:52,225
And he went in and he cut the entire
last eight minutes of the picture.

1422
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:55,895
He showed it to me very nervously.
He cut in a day or two.

1423
01:43:56,063 --> 01:44:01,526
He showed it to me very nervously
and I watched the whole thing and I said

1424
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:06,489
"It's perfect. It's absolutely perfect.
Don't change anything." And that was that.

1425
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:11,160
He felt like it was such a huge victory
because he had actually got it.

1426
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,664
He had mastered the style for the film.

1427
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:19,836
Sigourney, she's very liberal politically

1428
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:24,257
and despised the idea
of any kind of guns or anything,

1429
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:26,885
and tried to talk me
out of them having weapons.

1430
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:29,554
I said "They're marines.
They'd have weapons."

1431
01:44:29,722 --> 01:44:33,600
She said "Do I have to carry a weapon?"
I said "Yes."

1432
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:38,354
She said "Why?" l said "Because it's not
Sigourney Weaver in the film. It's Ripley."

1433
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:40,356
"And Ripley wants to survive."

1434
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:45,403
So I took her out shooting a Thompson
machine gun, out behind the studio,

1435
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:50,033
and she fired off
a 50-round magazine from the hip.

1436
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:56,372
And then she looked up at me with
this sly grin and said "That's really fun."

1437
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:59,334
Another liberal bites the dust.

1438
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:03,379
There were a few things she asked if
she could do when we had our first meeting.

1439
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:07,550
She wanted to die in the film,
she wanted to not use guns

1440
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,219
and she wanted to make love
to the alien.

1441
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:15,183
And between the third and fourth film
she got to do all of those things.

1442
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:20,146
But fortunately for this film, I said no to
all of them, even though I was petrified.

1443
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:24,567
I thought she'd bolt from the project,
but she didn't.

1444
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:28,780
She had a lot of good ideas.
But she did have certain specific things

1445
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:32,700
she thought should be done
in the Alien mythos.

1446
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:36,663
When she got to a position of power
on the later films, she made that happen.

1447
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:40,583
(Winston) This scene coming up
with Ripley and Newt,

1448
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,169
which is the attack of the facehuggers,

1449
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:48,091
was a really tough scene
to orchestrate, prepare for,

1450
01:45:48,258 --> 01:45:53,846
as far as we think
we're now back 1 6 or 1 7 years.

1451
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:58,184
So we don't have
any kind of digital animation

1452
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:01,479
and there's not gonna be
any stop-motion animation,

1453
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:04,148
and these facehuggers
have gotta come to life,

1454
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:11,114
so we created I think
a half dozen different facehuggers

1455
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:15,034
that would do different things
to create the performance coming up,

1456
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:20,915
including our hero,
which had completely articulated hands,

1457
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:28,840
multiple cables that had to be controlled
by six puppeteers for one facehugger.

1458
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:33,261
We had one that would run across the floor.
We called him our pull toy.

1459
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:39,142
We had stunt facehuggers
that we could throw to hit the wall.

1460
01:46:39,309 --> 01:46:43,229
We had actually two different heroes.

1461
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:48,568
There's the one that crawls
up over the counter coming at Newt.

1462
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:54,157
And then a completely articulated one
with tongue and fingers

1463
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:56,868
that Ripley would fight off

1464
01:46:57,036 --> 01:47:01,998
with all of the cables down her arms
through the whole sequence.

1465
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:05,084
And there's so much that happens in that.

1466
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:09,380
You think of the facehugger
that's coming after them,

1467
01:47:09,548 --> 01:47:13,885
and multiple to create that one scene.

1468
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:20,224
(Biehn) This is, to me,
the creepiest part of the movie.

1469
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:25,897
This thing running around,
that sound effect he did of the facehugger.

1470
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:31,986
(Henriksen) The first scenes of this movie
when he did the chestbuster.

1471
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:36,240
The sequel, Alien -
he took care of it in five minutes.

1472
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:39,911
- That first scene. That it was a dream.
- (Paxton) That was great.

1473
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:43,081
(Henriksen) I thought it was so smart.
It was just great.

1474
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:46,709
- His storytelling.
- (Biehn) The sound effects.

1475
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,087
(Goldstein) That scrabbling noise.

1476
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:54,008
(Paxton) The way this whole thing was laid
out in the first Alien and the second one,

1477
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:57,762
the whole genesis of the way
it would start out in the pod

1478
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:02,266
and then it turned into the facehugger
and then it turned into the alien.

1479
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:09,482
(Robert) A lot of the shots
of it scuttling along the floor

1480
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,651
were done on our miniature stage.

1481
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:16,572
That shot where it just scuttled by was done
right next to the twelfth-scale cargo lock.

1482
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:20,326
At the base of the twelfth-scale cargo lock
there was a little set there.

1483
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:25,248
So Jim would have five or six or seven little
setups poked in between our miniatures.

1484
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:30,169
We'd fog up the stage and get ready to
shoot, but he needed to shoot with no fog,

1485
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:34,090
so we'd clear the stage, he'd shoot his
thing and then we would continue on.

1486
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:38,761
So it was like one giant filmmaking unit but
we were doing two or three miniature shots

1487
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:43,516
simultaneously and he was doing
four or five live-action inserts.

1488
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:47,270
(Dennis) A concentrated dose
of Aliens filming.

1489
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:50,982
(Cameron) It's very hard to see Paul Reiser
as such an evil guy,

1490
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:54,318
after so many years of his TV series.

1491
01:48:54,486 --> 01:48:58,656
(Henriksen) He used to hate to ride to work
with me. I used ride to work with him.

1492
01:48:58,824 --> 01:49:03,202
- (Biehn) And he didn't like it?
- He hated it. I was like a real primitive.

1493
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:06,622
- He's a sophisticated comic.
- (Paxton) What were you doing?

1494
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,959
(Henriksen) I was always
grunting and groaning.

1495
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:16,591
- (Biehn) Smoking, burping.
- He hated everything about me.

1496
01:49:16,758 --> 01:49:18,551
(Henriksen) What a boring ride that was.

1497
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,804
(Paxton) You've been
carrying this baggage a while.

1498
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:26,809
- This is a good forum.
- (Henriksen) Let it rip, baby.

1499
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:29,937
(Paxton) It was because of
the character he was playing.

1500
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:33,316
He's such a prissy, corporate guy in this.

1501
01:49:33,483 --> 01:49:35,735
It's tough in these kind of movies.

1502
01:49:35,903 --> 01:49:41,407
(Biehn) Especially when you're young,
if you're playing a good guy,

1503
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:43,743
you're always hanging
with the good guys.

1504
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:47,371
You don't trust yourself as an actor
to be friendly with the bad guys.

1505
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:51,209
(Paxton) "One of the bad guys
might wreck my big scene."

1506
01:49:51,376 --> 01:49:52,668
(laughter)

1507
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:56,547
(Biehn) We were too serious as actors
to be able to hang with Paul.

1508
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:59,926
(Henriksen) He was reading the paper
the whole time.

1509
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:02,595
It was like I was interrupting
if I talked to him.

1510
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:05,264
(Paxton) You didn't wanna ride
to work with me?

1511
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:10,645
- I was in a different area.
- (Paxton) You were right round the corner.

1512
01:50:10,812 --> 01:50:14,357
- You didn't want me with you.
- Bullshit.

1513
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:19,528
(Cameron) We're yanking
these facehuggers around.

1514
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:25,284
I called them rubber-chicken facehuggers
cos they were these floppy ones.

1515
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:30,373
The crawling one had
a mechanism inside it.

1516
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:35,628
That was shot backwards. We pulled
the tail off and shot it backwards.

1517
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:42,718
There was a pretty good mechanism built
into the ones that are really articulated,

1518
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:46,681
but a lot of the time we were just
yanking them around on fishing line

1519
01:50:46,848 --> 01:50:49,016
and doing it in cuts.

1520
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:53,562
People probably wonder why I had him shoot
the window before he jumped through it.

1521
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:56,107
The idea was it's tempered glass.

1522
01:50:56,275 --> 01:51:02,071
You have to get the crystal structure of the
glass to shatter before you can go through it.

1523
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:09,245
So this is a bunch of grown people
fighting a rubber chicken, basically.

1524
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:16,460
But, of course, it's the actors
that make the effects real in our minds.

1525
01:51:16,628 --> 01:51:21,924
(Biehn) Great sequence. I love the red light
that he uses in this too. The warning light.

1526
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:28,097
That happens in the other sequence too when
the aliens are coming through the roof. Look.

1527
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:33,686
(Carrie) This is another scene that
James Cameron sets up as the family scene.

1528
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:39,775
There's just the three of us there
as a family, ready for Alien 3.

1529
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:45,489
(Cameron) David Fincher did a really
good job photographically and so on.

1530
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:49,702
I think it's really a well-made film,
visually.

1531
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:52,955
It's just kind of a slap in the face
of the fans

1532
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:58,002
who invested in Newt and Hicks
and all of those character relationships.

1533
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:02,006
I understand the instinct, of course,
which is you have to make it your own.

1534
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:04,091
I just don't think you should
make it your own

1535
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:07,261
at the expense of what
people like, personally.

1536
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:11,140
But everybody's gonna make
their own decisions.

1537
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:16,187
But I had to change some things
and make it my own on my film.

1538
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:20,816
And I know that Ridley probably watched it
and wasn't pleased with a lot of things.

1539
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:24,779
He probably wasn't pleased
with the fact that he hadn't made it.

1540
01:52:24,946 --> 01:52:27,823
But I think it's tough.

1541
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:33,621
It's tough to see somebody continue on
something that you've started.

1542
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:38,501
But then you learn to just get over it
because that's the nature of this business.

1543
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:42,880
I think the trick to this type of film
is you just take it utterly seriously.

1544
01:52:43,048 --> 01:52:48,427
You don't step outside yourself and try to
have fun with it and wink at the audience.

1545
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:50,596
You take it absolutely seriously

1546
01:52:50,764 --> 01:52:54,016
and you don't give the audience
a chance to question it.

1547
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:57,770
And if the actors can sell it,
then it works.

1548
01:52:58,855 --> 01:53:04,193
This is a distinction. I never got the sense in
the first film that the alien had an intelligence

1549
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:07,029
that allowed it to manipulate
their technology,

1550
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:10,533
but I didn't see that
necessarily as a barrier here

1551
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:15,037
because certainly these creatures
have been around longer.

1552
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:18,374
The alien in the first film
had only been alive for 24 hours.

1553
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:22,878
It was still an infant,
even though it had grown full size.

1554
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:26,090
These aliens have had weeks or months
to figure things out.

1555
01:53:26,258 --> 01:53:30,136
There's no reason why they couldn't
figure out the electrical system.

1556
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:33,305
Not that they're technological,
but the rudimentary stuff.

1557
01:53:33,473 --> 01:53:35,850
The implication is that
they're pretty clever.

1558
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:41,272
It's clear by the end of the film that the
alien queen knows how to operate an elevator.

1559
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:47,361
(Hurd) It's amazing how such a low-tech
little device that Jim sets up early on

1560
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:49,405
really builds the tension.

1561
01:53:49,573 --> 01:53:53,701
You don't have to see them.
You just see that locator

1562
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:59,081
and you realize they're getting closer
with a little sound effect.

1563
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:03,711
(Robert) This is one of
the first films we worked on

1564
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:07,965
that we worked with a video
to look at our effects.

1565
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:12,595
Prior to that you would shoot a shot
and go by your perception at the moment

1566
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:16,098
as to whether it worked or not
and looking at dailies the next day.

1567
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:18,642
You didn't see an instant replay.

1568
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:25,983
But on this film we used a video tap and
offside video camera on some of the shots

1569
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:29,737
to analyze what worked and what didn't.

1570
01:54:29,905 --> 01:54:33,491
(McClung) It was fairly expensive
to have a video tap camera.

1571
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:37,661
In most effects stuff,
the cameras used were...

1572
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:41,415
These old Mitchell cameras were great
but they didn't have video tap.

1573
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:46,003
It was an expense
a lot of times you couldn't afford.

1574
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:51,842
- (Goldstein) More welding.
- (Biehn) Just don't look at it.

1575
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:56,222
- (Goldstein) Look away or you'll be blinded.
- (Biehn) Weld it but don't look at it.

1576
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:58,390
(Goldstein) Put your hand there.
Don't look at it.

1577
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:03,979
- (Henriksen) Is this where you bite it?
- (Biehn) Yeah. Well, pretty soon.

1578
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:08,484
(Paxton) I'm gonna keep talking,
even if l'm dead.

1579
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:15,741
(Biehn) I don't know if you remember, Bill.
I had to ask Jim to go after you.

1580
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:21,038
He was just gonna have you being pulled
down. I'm like "Let me go after him."

1581
01:55:21,206 --> 01:55:24,542
- It was a nice thing.
- (Paxton) I remember.

1582
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:29,213
(Biehn) I think about how much shooting
we did in this sequence

1583
01:55:29,381 --> 01:55:33,092
with those pulse rifles and the full loads.

1584
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:38,013
(Paxton) I was standing to the right of
you, so I got to eat a few of those.

1585
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:40,182
I was catching the shells.

1586
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:43,519
(Biehn) This was a hard-core sequence.

1587
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:47,690
- (Paxton) It was the first time...
- You had the earplugs in.

1588
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:51,944
(Paxton) But it was one of the few times
we really got to shoot those guns off,

1589
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:55,698
which was great
cos we were carrying them all the time.

1590
01:55:55,865 --> 01:55:59,577
- This is it right here.
- (Henriksen) This is a great shot.

1591
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:04,206
That one right there.
Looking up and seeing these dudes.

1592
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:06,584
(Paxton) This is great. POV.

1593
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:08,502
(all) Ooh!

1594
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:09,712
(laughter)

1595
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:12,965
(Paxton) There's a whole nest of
them things coming out of there.

1596
01:56:13,133 --> 01:56:17,052
They're coming out of the woodwork.
Let 'em have it, Vasquez.

1597
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,097
Come on, Hicks. Get your gun off.

1598
01:56:22,142 --> 01:56:25,394
(Cameron) The alien head
in the first film was very smooth.

1599
01:56:25,562 --> 01:56:30,441
The top was smooth. Underneath
it had a skull shape and a ribbed design.

1600
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:37,239
Originally it was designed to see that through
a transparent surface in the Giger design.

1601
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:41,327
I thought what was under the surface
was more interesting than the final look,

1602
01:56:41,494 --> 01:56:44,079
so we just modified it slightly.

1603
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:49,293
We used a lot of strobe lights to
simulate the back blast of their weapons.

1604
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:53,172
Every time they're firing weapons,
we're aiming strobes at the actors,

1605
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:59,637
which created a nice sense of a lot of energy
flying around as they fire these weapons.

1606
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:04,892
- (Biehn) Did you say "motherfucker"?
- (Paxton) I think I did.

1607
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:09,647
I think I've used up my quota there.
That could have been my quota.

1608
01:57:09,814 --> 01:57:11,106
(laughter)

1609
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:17,905
(Biehn) "You want some?" That's a good
one. "You want some? Come on, I got it."

1610
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:23,118
- (Paxton) And then I get pulled below.
- (Biehn) Oh, man.

1611
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:27,289
(Paxton) That was good.

1612
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,917
(Biehn) And that thing comes up...

1613
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,004
(Paxton) There it goes.

1614
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:38,008
- From here on out...
- (Biehn) The movie dies right there.

1615
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:40,552
(Paxton) The movie's
just not quite the same.

1616
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:44,723
- (Henriksen) He had the script for Near Dark.
- (Paxton) This movie just doesn't stop.

1617
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:48,352
(Henriksen) You had the script for Near
Dark and were thinking about that.

1618
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,856
(Paxton) The movie just goes into overdrive
from here on out, right to the bitter end.

1619
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:55,067
It just doesn't stop.

1620
01:57:56,986 --> 01:58:00,948
(Hurd) There's an editing technique
that Jim likes to use which is blank frames

1621
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:05,953
in between the discharge from the weapons,
sort of whites out the frame.

1622
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:09,832
It really helps the staccato cutting.

1623
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,464
(Cameron) I was having them splice together
individual frames of white flash leader.

1624
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:19,299
The negative cutter said -

1625
01:58:19,467 --> 01:58:22,845
we did a lot of flash frames
and one-frame cuts in that sequence -

1626
01:58:23,012 --> 01:58:26,014
we had more edits
in this reel 1 2 of Aliens

1627
01:58:26,182 --> 01:58:31,979
than in any complete film
the negative cutter had done before.

1628
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,360
So the whole high-tech war
has degenerated to the point

1629
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:43,365
where they have to follow the little kid
or they're gonna die.

1630
01:58:44,492 --> 01:58:47,244
Movie air ducts are always
big enough to get through.

1631
01:58:47,412 --> 01:58:49,455
It bears no resemblance to the real world.

1632
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:52,958
The theory is that the audience
has never been inside an air duct.

1633
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:56,128
Air ducts are not big enough
to walk through.

1634
01:58:56,296 --> 01:59:01,300
But it's a conceit. It's also a
conceit taken from the first film.

1635
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:06,013
(Carrie) Supposedly,
the way l survived in the colony

1636
01:59:06,181 --> 01:59:09,391
was going around everywhere
in the air ducts.

1637
01:59:09,559 --> 01:59:11,435
We supposedly played a game

1638
01:59:11,603 --> 01:59:16,273
and part of the reason I was called Newt
is because I was so quick in the air ducts

1639
01:59:16,441 --> 01:59:20,569
and no one really liked me on the colony
because I beat them at the game.

1640
01:59:20,737 --> 01:59:25,741
Fortunately it ended up
saving us from the aliens at this time.

1641
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:29,411
(Winston) For this air-duct set,
we had vertical air ducts

1642
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:34,500
so that we could actually drop
the aliens down with the monofilament,

1643
01:59:34,667 --> 01:59:37,419
so that you would feel -
and you'll see it in here -

1644
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:40,839
feel them crawling
on the ceilings and the walls,

1645
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:43,467
that bug aspect of them.

1646
01:59:44,552 --> 01:59:48,222
- (Hurd) My cameo's coming up.
- (Winston) Who were you?

1647
01:59:48,389 --> 01:59:53,602
(Hurd) Vasquez had never fired a handgun.
Jenette Goldstein hadn't.

1648
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:57,940
She was living in England.
Not a lot of handguns.

1649
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:05,072
For the wide shot she was great, but for
the close-up of her killing the alien,

1650
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:07,533
her recoil wasn't accurate.

1651
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,952
Unlike today, when I'm on a set,

1652
02:00:10,119 --> 02:00:14,164
I dressed up in suits on this film
and the crew couldn't believe it...

1653
02:00:14,332 --> 02:00:18,794
- That's me. That's me.
- (Winston) All right, girl!

1654
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:25,259
(Hurd) All of the close-ups
of the handgun firing at the alien was me.

1655
02:00:25,426 --> 02:00:28,762
People couldn't believe it,
since I always dressed up in suits.

1656
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:33,475
I needed something to give myself
the appearance of authority.

1657
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:37,187
When I came in in the fatigues
and fired a gun...

1658
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:40,607
- (Winston) They saw the real Gale.
- They were pretty surprised.

1659
02:00:40,775 --> 02:00:46,113
Jim told me that I was in my office and the
crew were saying "What are we gonna do?"

1660
02:00:46,281 --> 02:00:50,784
"Who here has ever fired
a handgun before?"

1661
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:53,412
And he said "My wife has."

1662
02:00:54,873 --> 02:00:59,918
He said "I'm gonna go get her
and she's gonna do the shot." And I did.

1663
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:02,629
(Cameron) Jenette has very fair skin,

1664
02:01:02,797 --> 02:01:06,174
freckles and had hair down
to her waist and blue eyes.

1665
02:01:06,342 --> 02:01:09,344
So somehow we managed to see
that if we cut all her hair off

1666
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:13,223
and gave her dark make-up
and brown contact lenses,

1667
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:18,937
she was actor enough to actually
pull off this Hispanic character.

1668
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:27,029
(Winston) That was a tough actual
physical effect. There was nothing optical.

1669
02:01:27,196 --> 02:01:32,367
That fireball came flying
through that corridor.

1670
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:38,040
(Hurd) We didn't have digital anything
back then. We didn't have digital fire.

1671
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,251
(Carrie) This is cool. It was a chute.

1672
02:01:41,419 --> 02:01:45,547
It was about three stories high
and it had a big old curve at the end.

1673
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:49,843
I kept sometimes messing up
so that I could redo it.

1674
02:01:50,011 --> 02:01:57,225
(Cameron) Important survival tips in this
film. Never grab the jacket. Grab the hand.

1675
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:04,483
Unless you have a Newt-finder device
in your pocket, then you're OK.

1676
02:02:08,905 --> 02:02:13,075
Gene Siskel had a big problem
with this scene

1677
02:02:13,242 --> 02:02:18,580
because of the jeopardy
of a little child with an alien monster.

1678
02:02:18,748 --> 02:02:22,876
That never occurred to me, but I
wasn't a parent when I made this film.

1679
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:25,295
It probably would bother me more now

1680
02:02:25,463 --> 02:02:28,924
because I could empathize
too much with the child.

1681
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:33,178
The thing that never bothered me about
the idea of putting a child in jeopardy

1682
02:02:33,346 --> 02:02:38,684
is that somehow you just know inherently
that Ripley's not gonna let her die,

1683
02:02:38,851 --> 02:02:40,936
no matter what it takes.

1684
02:02:44,273 --> 02:02:48,735
I know they spent a lot of time
on the first film finding a big guy,

1685
02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:54,449
building a suit that the tall guy could wear,
but in watching that movie and studying it,

1686
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:59,871
I realized that the alien almost never appears
in the same frame with a person for scale,

1687
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:04,167
and so we just decided to use normal
six-foot-tall people, cos we needed a lot.

1688
02:03:04,335 --> 02:03:08,672
We knew we couldn't find
ten seven-and-half-foot-tall guys.

1689
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:12,217
Probably the only exception
is when the alien rises up behind her,

1690
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:17,222
but I figured that wasn't a problem
cos she was small anyway.

1691
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:19,850
We create the scale in our minds anyway.

1692
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:25,522
(Winston) Michael was so good at this.

1693
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:28,734
This shot is in my show reel still.

1694
02:03:28,901 --> 02:03:35,991
If you examine it now, you can see the
monofilament on the tail, pulling it up.

1695
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:40,370
I hate to low-tech it,
but it's what it was.

1696
02:03:41,914 --> 02:03:43,832
Goodbye.

1697
02:03:44,917 --> 02:03:49,796
(Paxton) You just see
the little doll head as it sinks.

1698
02:03:49,964 --> 02:03:54,176
(Biehn) That's where Jim over and over
again has those images like that.

1699
02:03:54,343 --> 02:03:57,429
(Paxton) There it is right there.

1700
02:03:57,597 --> 02:04:00,057
The eyes kind of close.

1701
02:04:03,061 --> 02:04:07,731
(Biehn) This is where
they use that A-B smoke on me.

1702
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:10,734
(Paxton) That stuff's nasty.

1703
02:04:10,902 --> 02:04:15,072
- (Goldstein) They used that on Near Dark.
- (Henriksen) They've outlawed it.

1704
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:17,032
(Biehn) Hard-core stuff.

1705
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:21,369
(Henriksen) You breathe that in
and you get lung damage.

1706
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,039
(Paxton) It's tough
when you're doing these shots.

1707
02:04:24,207 --> 02:04:28,460
It becomes all about
if the smoke reacted right.

1708
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:33,715
(Biehn) I've always thought the worst job
on any set is the guy who makes the smoke.

1709
02:04:33,883 --> 02:04:36,885
Less smoke, more smoke.
Waft it up, waft it down.

1710
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:39,930
Fire that guy. Get a new smoke guy.

1711
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:44,518
(Cameron) Elevator doors
never close fast enough for me.

1712
02:04:44,685 --> 02:04:48,563
It's just a pet peeve
with the way the world is wired.

1713
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:56,613
(Robert) The shot of the vest getting hit by
acid was an insert that was shot on M stage

1714
02:04:56,781 --> 02:05:02,244
as we were shooting the dropship
flying out of the atmosphere processor.

1715
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:05,997
As it's blowing up,
Jim was shooting with his back to us.

1716
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:13,255
He was stepping on our track
that the camera ran on,

1717
02:05:13,422 --> 02:05:15,173
while it was being photographed.

1718
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:18,593
He would step off the track
and we'd run the camera down the track.

1719
02:05:18,761 --> 02:05:20,595
(McClung) And there was A-B smoke

1720
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:25,267
drifting over into our area
which made it hard to breathe.

1721
02:05:25,434 --> 02:05:28,979
(Dennis) Miniature on wires here.

1722
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:34,276
(Robert) Again, recalling that these
miniatures are moving very fast in reality.

1723
02:05:34,443 --> 02:05:37,487
We're seeing them here slowed down.

1724
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:44,161
(Dennis) We run the camera at high speed for
miniature work to give a lot more scale.

1725
02:05:44,328 --> 02:05:47,789
It gives it the size that's needed
to make it feel believable.

1726
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:53,962
If you were to see it as it actually happens,
it would look like the small scale that it is,

1727
02:05:54,297 --> 02:05:56,923
so this is why it's done.

1728
02:05:58,509 --> 02:06:02,804
(Robert) We'd gone back in after we built
the atmosphere-processor miniature

1729
02:06:02,972 --> 02:06:09,811
and before we did this shot we had a whole
crew - well, four or five guys, including us -

1730
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:15,066
running in and adding extra detail because
we were pushing into the interior of it.

1731
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:21,990
So we had a day and a half of heavy-duty
microdetailing going on there.

1732
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:31,875
(Paxton) This movie laid the foundation
for me for a lot of stuff.

1733
02:06:32,043 --> 02:06:34,419
Again, it was working for Jim
that was really fantastic.

1734
02:06:35,379 --> 02:06:39,257
I remember running into Jim
when he'd been hired to write this.

1735
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:44,137
I was at the airport. He was
handing off a parcel to some courier.

1736
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:48,225
I don't know why. I guess because
they were setting up shop in England.

1737
02:06:48,392 --> 02:06:51,269
He said "I'm writing the sequel to Alien."

1738
02:06:51,437 --> 02:06:55,273
I said "Write me a good part in there."
I kidded him.

1739
02:06:55,441 --> 02:07:00,362
Six months later I tried out for it in
England and I didn't think I'd gotten it.

1740
02:07:00,529 --> 02:07:03,365
Your friends are usually
the last people to hire you.

1741
02:07:03,532 --> 02:07:05,867
Cos you have no mystique with them.

1742
02:07:06,035 --> 02:07:12,916
And then I got a call. I almost took Police
Academy 3 or something, and then I got this.

1743
02:07:13,084 --> 02:07:16,002
More money than l'd ever seen in my life.

1744
02:07:17,421 --> 02:07:21,007
They hired
Bob Wildcat Goldthwait instead.

1745
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:22,884
(laughter)

1746
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:27,514
I don't know who got the better deal,
but I think I did.

1747
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:33,937
(Cameron) Everybody was looking at the film
as well-made in the sound and visual effects,

1748
02:07:34,105 --> 02:07:37,649
but we were pleasantly surprised
when Sigourney got nominated.

1749
02:07:37,817 --> 02:07:40,902
Not that we didn't think
her performance was worthy,

1750
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:45,740
but there was no precedent
for a horror film

1751
02:07:45,908 --> 02:07:48,785
being honored by the Academy for acting.

1752
02:07:48,953 --> 02:07:55,458
The fact they took it seriously
I think still is a real milestone.

1753
02:07:57,003 --> 02:07:58,523
(Winston) Interesting thing coming up.

1754
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:01,423
Another shot that Jim stuck me with

1755
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:05,343
but it's really kind of fun
is when we meet the queen alien.

1756
02:08:05,511 --> 02:08:08,930
This is gonna come much later.

1757
02:08:09,098 --> 02:08:12,225
She ends up back in the elevator shaft.

1758
02:08:12,393 --> 02:08:16,730
In fact, the elevator shaft is not nearly
big enough to hold the queen alien,

1759
02:08:16,897 --> 02:08:20,692
so only her front half is in the shaft.

1760
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:24,154
The rest of her is sticking
out the back of the elevator on the set,

1761
02:08:24,322 --> 02:08:26,781
but you never really
think about it in the movie

1762
02:08:26,949 --> 02:08:29,617
when that elevator opens
and the queen comes out,

1763
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:32,329
that she would never be able to fit in it.

1764
02:08:32,496 --> 02:08:37,542
And since 90 per cent of the queen
alien stuff in this movie is all full size,

1765
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:43,631
we had to deal with the sets based on the reality
of her size and the reality of the sets.

1766
02:08:45,718 --> 02:08:50,263
I never forget Jim coming to me
when he first had written the screenplay.

1767
02:08:50,431 --> 02:08:52,849
He said "I've got this idea
for the queen alien."

1768
02:08:53,017 --> 02:08:55,060
"We'll get a couple of guys in a suit.

1769
02:08:55,227 --> 02:08:58,229
It'll have four arms.
We'll carry it on a crane arm."

1770
02:08:58,397 --> 02:09:03,401
"We'll have puppeteers working the legs." I'm
going "He's completely out of his mind."

1771
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:08,740
Then a split second later
"No, it's Jim, so it probably'll work."

1772
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:13,703
- (Hurd) Remember when we did it with the...
- (Winston) The garbage-bag test.

1773
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:19,000
(Hurd) Exactly. Do it first and make sure
it works before you do the design.

1774
02:09:20,503 --> 02:09:23,713
(Winston) So we rented
a little crane behind my studio

1775
02:09:23,881 --> 02:09:29,094
and built a little body form for
two stunt men, ski poles for arms,

1776
02:09:29,261 --> 02:09:32,889
foam-core legs, rod puppets,
foam-core head,

1777
02:09:33,057 --> 02:09:37,018
and looked at it
and "You know what? It works."

1778
02:09:37,186 --> 02:09:39,104
(Hurd) Same with the power loader.

1779
02:09:39,271 --> 02:09:43,525
We did all that in foam core first
to make sure the concept worked.

1780
02:09:43,692 --> 02:09:47,904
Unfortunately, it was too heavy
and had to be supported by the crane.

1781
02:09:48,072 --> 02:09:51,241
(Winston) By the wires.
But you'd never know that in the movie.

1782
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:52,450
(Hurd) No.

1783
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:55,370
(Winston) The queen,
when she drops out of the dropship,

1784
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:57,872
she's virtually a huge marionette,

1785
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:01,709
and there are wires in the shot
and we never see 'em.

1786
02:10:01,877 --> 02:10:05,880
Wires on each of her legs, her entire body,
when she comes down out of it.

1787
02:10:06,048 --> 02:10:11,219
It's a 14-foot
hydraulically operated marionette.

1788
02:10:13,055 --> 02:10:17,183
I learned to have a great deal of respect
for second unit directors doing this movie

1789
02:10:17,351 --> 02:10:20,770
cos I had to shoot second unit,
small shots and big shots.

1790
02:10:20,938 --> 02:10:24,399
And to have to make sure
that every light and everything

1791
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:26,985
was exactly the way Jim wanted it

1792
02:10:27,153 --> 02:10:31,281
so that it fit in seamlessly
makes you realize that that job,

1793
02:10:31,449 --> 02:10:37,120
which fortunately I haven't done
since working with Jim, is a rough job,

1794
02:10:37,288 --> 02:10:44,586
because it's not being creative, it's making
sure you're doing what the director wants.

1795
02:10:45,629 --> 02:10:50,008
(Carrie) It originally started that Sigourney
was supposed to have run into Paul Reiser

1796
02:10:50,176 --> 02:10:52,927
and he did a cocoon scene as well,

1797
02:10:53,095 --> 02:10:55,597
and she gave him a grenade.

1798
02:10:55,764 --> 02:11:02,353
And later on in the movie,
there's a part where it's a big old boom,

1799
02:11:02,521 --> 02:11:07,692
and it was supposed to have been
him setting off the grenade.

1800
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:14,741
But obviously no one really knows any of
that because it was cut out of the movie.

1801
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:24,626
(Paxton) I run into Sigourney once in a blue
moon at an airport lounge or something.

1802
02:11:24,793 --> 02:11:30,131
She's always great. She remembers
Louise's name, my wife's name.

1803
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:33,718
- A very thoughtful woman.
- (Henriksen) Gracious.

1804
02:11:33,886 --> 02:11:39,390
(Paxton) She made this series what it is.
Without her, it just wouldn't be the same.

1805
02:11:39,558 --> 02:11:46,147
Also Ridley Scott and Jim, they both really
showed up loaded for bear on these films.

1806
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:50,193
I've never followed the other movies.
I couldn't tell you much about...

1807
02:11:50,361 --> 02:11:53,655
(Henriksen) I thought Ridley was
doing the third and Jim the fourth.

1808
02:11:53,822 --> 02:11:58,201
(Paxton) That was David Fincher. I've
seen a lot of his movies and liked 'em.

1809
02:11:58,369 --> 02:12:00,662
(Henriksen) Yeah, he's great.

1810
02:12:03,499 --> 02:12:07,794
(Cameron) I personally installed Carrie
in this cos I wanted to make sure

1811
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:12,090
it was done in a way that wouldn't hurt her
or create any discomfort.

1812
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:18,429
So I'm smearing this gak all over her and
she looks up at me and says very quietly

1813
02:12:18,597 --> 02:12:21,849
"It should be illegal
for you to do this to little kids."

1814
02:12:22,017 --> 02:12:24,185
(laughs)

1815
02:12:25,688 --> 02:12:29,107
She was just winding me up.
She wasn't serious.

1816
02:12:29,275 --> 02:12:36,489
(Carrie) The cocoon was probably one of the
most horrendous scenes that I had to film.

1817
02:12:36,657 --> 02:12:41,953
There was a little hole and they made it
just big enough for me to crawl through.

1818
02:12:42,121 --> 02:12:46,833
It was all made out of fiberglass and l
couldn't actually even put my feet down.

1819
02:12:47,001 --> 02:12:51,754
I would sit in there for what seemed like
hours on end but I doubt it was.

1820
02:12:51,922 --> 02:12:56,342
I couldn't rest my feet on it in case it broke.
I couldn't do anything in case it broke.

1821
02:12:56,510 --> 02:13:01,306
We just had to keep replaying it
over and over again, and it took days.

1822
02:13:01,473 --> 02:13:05,435
When Sigourney
actually tears apart the cocoon,

1823
02:13:05,603 --> 02:13:09,272
because it was made out of fiberglass,
she tore her hands all up.

1824
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,734
They were all bleeding and everything.

1825
02:13:12,901 --> 02:13:15,403
This was just not a fun scene to film.

1826
02:13:15,738 --> 02:13:18,239
It took forever.

1827
02:13:26,081 --> 02:13:28,583
(Winston) We also had to replicate
Carrie for this

1828
02:13:28,751 --> 02:13:32,795
because of all the shots
that Sigourney was gonna have to carry her.

1829
02:13:32,963 --> 02:13:36,674
(Hurd) And she was too heavy.
And it was also Sigourney's back.

1830
02:13:36,842 --> 02:13:42,764
(Winston) Exactly. So we built
a little replication of Carrie's body.

1831
02:13:42,931 --> 02:13:46,643
It was actually a really beautiful dummy

1832
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:50,647
that she carries through much of the scene
after she saves her.

1833
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:56,611
It's not enough to build
a 14-foot queen alien.

1834
02:13:56,779 --> 02:14:01,532
It's gotta have a head
that comes out of its helmet-like head.

1835
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:06,621
This was a great shot.
This was a combination of miniature

1836
02:14:06,789 --> 02:14:11,668
and then we built the last part of the egg
sac and attached it to the full-sized queen.

1837
02:14:11,835 --> 02:14:18,966
This is all full size. This is full-size 14-foot
queen when we see her for the first time.

1838
02:14:19,134 --> 02:14:22,970
That's a big puppet.
And the extruding head.

1839
02:14:24,181 --> 02:14:27,308
We had to come up with
a new way of doing the teeth,

1840
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:33,314
making them translucent rather than metal,
as with the alien warriors.

1841
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:38,194
When Jim first came to me,
he had a painting of the queen alien.

1842
02:14:38,362 --> 02:14:41,698
Just like with The Terminator,
he had already had her designed.

1843
02:14:41,865 --> 02:14:48,746
I had some ideas and started doing
some drawings myself, one of the rear legs.

1844
02:14:48,914 --> 02:14:52,583
It ultimately ended up
being virtually Jim's original design.

1845
02:14:52,751 --> 02:14:57,130
I'll never forget the two of us
sitting on drawing boards at his house

1846
02:14:57,297 --> 02:15:00,508
where he would draw one part of her
and I'd draw the other part,

1847
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:03,261
and it would be all coming together.

1848
02:15:03,429 --> 02:15:06,556
He's one of the most talented artists
I ever had working for me.

1849
02:15:06,724 --> 02:15:07,849
(Hurd laughs)

1850
02:15:08,016 --> 02:15:11,018
(Hurd) I think he remembers it
a little differently.

1851
02:15:11,186 --> 02:15:16,482
(Winston) You don't think he'd look at it
like that, as an employee of Stan Winston's?

1852
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:21,571
(Hurd) I also love this sequence when
Ripley is communicating with the queen.

1853
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:26,200
"See, I can wipe out your children."

1854
02:15:27,536 --> 02:15:30,204
(Winston) I shot that shot.

1855
02:15:30,372 --> 02:15:33,750
(Hurd) She wants the queen
to call off her warriors,

1856
02:15:33,917 --> 02:15:38,045
and when the queen doesn't,
she goes to town.

1857
02:15:38,213 --> 02:15:40,757
(Winston) Kill the eggs.

1858
02:15:41,425 --> 02:15:46,304
(McClung) Wasn't there a puppeteer
whose hand was dropping the egg?

1859
02:15:46,472 --> 02:15:49,056
(Robert) That was Nigel.
He would push it out.

1860
02:15:49,224 --> 02:15:51,893
It was on a plex rod underneath the egg.

1861
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:57,523
Somebody was under the set to place it,
otherwise it would roll over and fall down.

1862
02:15:57,691 --> 02:16:01,277
(Dennis) My job was to take that egg
and shove it back in.

1863
02:16:01,445 --> 02:16:06,115
(Cameron) I know Sigourney still has
liberal guilt over this whole scene.

1864
02:16:06,283 --> 02:16:09,952
But this is the classic
cathartic purging with fire.

1865
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:12,663
You purge the nightmare
by burning it out.

1866
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:17,043
And the idea that this is the only way she's
ever gonna have psychological closure.

1867
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:19,921
Not, by the way, a new idea in films.

1868
02:16:20,088 --> 02:16:24,258
And probably one that doesn't have a whole
lot of basis in real human psychology.

1869
02:16:24,426 --> 02:16:27,220
It feels right to the audience,
but if you're that traumatized,

1870
02:16:27,387 --> 02:16:29,263
it wouldn't help you that much.

1871
02:16:29,431 --> 02:16:32,433
But she sure unleashes
holy hell on these guys.

1872
02:16:34,937 --> 02:16:42,610
(Robert) We had a sharpshooter fire
a real bullet into the miniature egg sac.

1873
02:16:42,778 --> 02:16:47,698
(Dennis) This is a miniature.
That's a front projection shot.

1874
02:16:47,866 --> 02:16:52,286
A lot of smoke in the air tends to take
the edge off of it. lt was a bit heavy.

1875
02:16:52,955 --> 02:16:55,164
Obscuring the plate.

1876
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:02,046
(Robert) There's a shot here
where the platform the queen is on,

1877
02:17:02,214 --> 02:17:05,800
there's a big explosion
when she tosses the weapons belt here,

1878
02:17:05,968 --> 02:17:07,969
and the queen, when it falls,

1879
02:17:08,136 --> 02:17:13,057
is actually quarter-scale miniature
in which we use a double-mirror setup.

1880
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:17,144
We had a beam splitter in the foreground
reflecting large-scale fire

1881
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:22,275
that was off to the right of the camera
and behind the puppet was another mirror

1882
02:17:22,442 --> 02:17:27,530
that was angled off to the left
where we had another very large-scale fire.

1883
02:17:29,825 --> 02:17:34,287
(Cameron) We had a full-size alien queen
and then we had this miniature one.

1884
02:17:34,454 --> 02:17:37,248
The miniature one flails a little bit.

1885
02:17:37,416 --> 02:17:43,129
The alien queen design could be created
so beautifully today with CG animation.

1886
02:17:43,297 --> 02:17:45,298
That didn't exist then,

1887
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:48,885
so we had to figure out how to do it
with more conventional means,

1888
02:17:49,052 --> 02:17:53,055
so it's a bunraku puppet
more than anything.

1889
02:17:57,144 --> 02:18:01,230
(Robert) This electrical-charge effect
was footage we acquired

1890
02:18:01,398 --> 02:18:03,858
from Gene Warren from Fantasy II.

1891
02:18:04,026 --> 02:18:08,946
He had several hundred feet
he had shot for the first Terminatorfilm.

1892
02:18:09,114 --> 02:18:12,033
We needed that type
of generic lightning effects

1893
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:14,660
and we had that film shipped over to us.

1894
02:18:14,828 --> 02:18:17,663
(Dennis) It was actually
tesla coil footage.

1895
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:20,917
Give credit where credit's due.

1896
02:18:21,084 --> 02:18:24,545
(Hurd) Once again, just the subtle things,
like the countdown,

1897
02:18:24,713 --> 02:18:29,550
reminding the characters and the
audience that there's a ticking clock.

1898
02:18:29,718 --> 02:18:32,678
(Winston) The huge queen alien
comes round the corner here.

1899
02:18:32,846 --> 02:18:37,224
It's one of our tougher shots,
for her to come out around the corner

1900
02:18:37,392 --> 02:18:40,478
and see her right here, and looking at her.

1901
02:18:40,646 --> 02:18:43,230
Neat performance.

1902
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:51,405
I'll never forget my first conversation
with Steven Spielberg about Jurassic Park

1903
02:18:51,573 --> 02:18:57,119
when he said to me
"You built a 14-foot alien, full-size."

1904
02:18:57,287 --> 02:19:00,081
"Why can't you do a dinosaur?"

1905
02:19:00,248 --> 02:19:03,209
Everything leads to something else.

1906
02:19:03,794 --> 02:19:08,923
The water weenie in Abyss
to the T-1 000 in T2.

1907
02:19:09,091 --> 02:19:12,468
(Hurd) Everything's R and D
for something you do later on.

1908
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:24,814
(Winston) This is the shot.
The queen just thinking, looking.

1909
02:19:24,982 --> 02:19:27,608
A little cock of the head,
knows what she's gonna do.

1910
02:19:27,776 --> 02:19:29,902
(Hurd) "I got a plan. I'm not stupid."

1911
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:31,946
(Winston) That woman can act.

1912
02:19:34,741 --> 02:19:38,911
(Cameron) The female computer voice that's
counting down is an intentional tie-in

1913
02:19:39,079 --> 02:19:44,792
to the first film, to create the same sense
of panic as the clock runs down.

1914
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:50,381
And then this is what you expect to happen,
that Bishop completely betrays them.

1915
02:19:50,549 --> 02:19:54,885
But I think what you don't expect
is that he didn't,

1916
02:19:55,804 --> 02:19:58,764
that he turns out to be a good guy.

1917
02:19:58,932 --> 02:20:01,892
People always expect the worst of others,
never the best.

1918
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:06,022
And so when a character
actually lives up to their promises,

1919
02:20:06,189 --> 02:20:11,360
and Bishop said he was gonna stay
and he did,

1920
02:20:12,529 --> 02:20:15,781
you don't expect it,
you don't see it coming.

1921
02:20:18,994 --> 02:20:22,705
This is a front-screen projection shot.

1922
02:20:22,873 --> 02:20:27,251
(Dennis) There's a dropship comes up
behind Ripley on this landing platform.

1923
02:20:27,419 --> 02:20:31,464
The element that we shot for that
was shot at high speed.

1924
02:20:31,631 --> 02:20:34,383
Because the camera's running
at such high speed,

1925
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:41,015
the actual movement was so fast, it's almost
not possible to move an object that quickly.

1926
02:20:47,564 --> 02:20:52,443
(Winston) Look at this.
Big old queen inside that little elevator.

1927
02:20:52,611 --> 02:20:55,529
(Hurd) We'll just keep it dark inside.

1928
02:20:55,697 --> 02:20:59,533
(Winston) It's a black curtain at the
back of it that she's coming through.

1929
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:02,328
(Dennis) You think it's all lost
and there it is.

1930
02:21:02,496 --> 02:21:06,332
It's hard to imagine how fast
that actually moved in real time.

1931
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:10,586
(Robert) Any time the miniature
is supposed to be traveling fast,

1932
02:21:10,754 --> 02:21:13,881
it had to be traveling
three, four, five times as fast.

1933
02:21:14,049 --> 02:21:17,384
This down-view was extended
with mirrors on the stage floor.

1934
02:21:17,552 --> 02:21:21,639
It was not apparent in the shot with
the fireball coming up, the earlier cut,

1935
02:21:21,807 --> 02:21:25,810
as you see this set
continuing very far down,

1936
02:21:25,977 --> 02:21:29,897
but those are mirrors on the studio floor.

1937
02:21:30,065 --> 02:21:32,817
(Dennis) In addition to the pyro,
we used flashbulbs,

1938
02:21:32,984 --> 02:21:36,487
buried in the set, to give extra flashes.

1939
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:42,785
(Hurd) This is another instance
where the score is so terrific as well.

1940
02:21:42,953 --> 02:21:47,331
When we were in the scoring stage, this
was the last cue that Jamie had finished.

1941
02:21:47,499 --> 02:21:50,918
And then there was no...
It was like "OK. And then what?"

1942
02:21:51,086 --> 02:21:54,130
"I didn't get around
to the last cue of the film."

1943
02:21:54,297 --> 02:22:00,928
And in a miraculous burst of creativity,
he generated the final cue overnight.

1944
02:22:01,096 --> 02:22:05,266
(Cameron) I didn't know how to work with
an orchestral composer when I made this.

1945
02:22:05,433 --> 02:22:10,020
I don't think James knew
how to work with directors that well.

1946
02:22:10,188 --> 02:22:14,108
I think he was a brilliant composer,
but he had a lot to learn and so did I.

1947
02:22:14,276 --> 02:22:18,404
By the way, that nuclear explosion
is a big light bulb.

1948
02:22:18,572 --> 02:22:21,323
Literally, a light bulb
covered with cotton.

1949
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:26,328
We didn't have any budget for a big effect
there, so we just made something up.

1950
02:22:26,496 --> 02:22:29,790
But it didn't create problems
between us personalitywise

1951
02:22:29,958 --> 02:22:34,003
but I went to the scoring session
expecting to hear the movie,

1952
02:22:34,171 --> 02:22:37,298
and an orchestra started to play
stuff that didn't work.

1953
02:22:37,465 --> 02:22:41,051
The music was beautiful, but it didn't
work on a scene-by-scene basis.

1954
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:43,929
I didn't know what to do.
There was no second round.

1955
02:22:44,097 --> 02:22:47,933
It was like "Here's your score."
And James went off to another film.

1956
02:22:48,101 --> 02:22:52,813
We wound up doing an awful lot
of music editing and moving stuff around.

1957
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:57,318
He was never happy with the outcome even
though he got an Academy Award nomination

1958
02:22:57,485 --> 02:23:01,655
cos it didn't reflect what he had created,
and I didn't like the process.

1959
02:23:01,823 --> 02:23:04,408
So when we got together on Titanic, I said:

1960
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:07,036
"What can we do
so that doesn't happen again?"

1961
02:23:07,204 --> 02:23:09,955
"Cos I like your music
and I want you to do this film."

1962
02:23:10,123 --> 02:23:13,834
So we worked out a methodology
by which we'd communicate better.

1963
02:23:14,002 --> 02:23:16,545
And that was a great experience,
by contrast.

1964
02:23:21,718 --> 02:23:26,430
(Winston) This is a great effect, of the
queen tail coming out through his body.

1965
02:23:26,598 --> 02:23:31,060
It's basically a soft tail
that we pulled with a monofilament.

1966
02:23:31,228 --> 02:23:35,356
And it works great.
You would never know it.

1967
02:23:35,523 --> 02:23:40,611
(McClung) Alec Gillis was throwing...
After Bishop was torn in half here,

1968
02:23:40,779 --> 02:23:45,366
you see his torso go one way,
the top part go the other way.

1969
02:23:45,533 --> 02:23:52,039
Alec would throw it and it would land
in these goofy, ridiculous positions.

1970
02:23:52,582 --> 02:23:56,961
(Winston) Setting up for this one shot
right here was two days of work,

1971
02:23:57,128 --> 02:23:59,672
to get that shot there.

1972
02:23:59,839 --> 02:24:02,967
(McClung) This shot of it landing
was shot over and over again.

1973
02:24:03,134 --> 02:24:04,718
(Robert) I remember seeing the dailies.

1974
02:24:04,886 --> 02:24:07,554
(McClung) The arms would land
behind its head.

1975
02:24:07,722 --> 02:24:10,891
It was one of those funny moments.

1976
02:24:11,059 --> 02:24:17,147
(Dennis) This sequence used a combination of
the full-size and the quarter-scale queen.

1977
02:24:17,315 --> 02:24:21,568
Where there was a lot of movement
across the floor, we'd use the miniature.

1978
02:24:21,736 --> 02:24:25,698
If it were in place or close-up,
we'd use the full-size.

1979
02:24:25,865 --> 02:24:29,827
(Winston) And this is the biggest marionette
in the history of motion pictures.

1980
02:24:29,995 --> 02:24:32,621
She is every technology we had.

1981
02:24:32,789 --> 02:24:37,293
She's rod puppet, she's hydraulic,
which was new to us, she's a breakthrough,

1982
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:43,424
radio-controlled, wired and rod,
all in that one beast.

1983
02:24:43,591 --> 02:24:45,551
(Hurd) And seamlessly intercut.

1984
02:24:45,719 --> 02:24:48,512
(Winston) With this miniature puppet
of Doug's.

1985
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:51,807
(Hurd) With a miniature puppet of Ripley.

1986
02:24:51,975 --> 02:24:56,937
This sequence in the fight between Ripley
and the power loader and the alien queen,

1987
02:24:57,105 --> 02:25:03,319
we used the movie cam which was able to
change the frame rate within one shot,

1988
02:25:03,486 --> 02:25:07,156
and were able to start
at 24 frames per second

1989
02:25:07,324 --> 02:25:11,660
and then go down
to 1 8 or 20 frames per second,

1990
02:25:11,828 --> 02:25:16,623
so that when the internal jaws came out,
they whipped out.

1991
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:20,461
(Cameron) When you analyze this scene,
it's all just quick cuts.

1992
02:25:20,628 --> 02:25:24,465
The alien's hand is in one shot
and you see a bit of the head and the hand,

1993
02:25:24,632 --> 02:25:27,301
but it's just all done with puppeting.

1994
02:25:30,972 --> 02:25:34,099
I think it's actually good.

1995
02:25:34,267 --> 02:25:39,897
The intention today would be to do it with
computer graphics and see it more full-figure,

1996
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:45,736
and I think seeing it in bits and pieces
is actually more powerful.

1997
02:25:47,197 --> 02:25:50,991
This was a hard shot. This is the
pylon rig. You can see it behind her.

1998
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:53,410
It's like a long crane arm.

1999
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:05,839
(Hurd) I remember seeing the film,
midnight screening on Hollywood Boulevard,

2000
02:26:06,007 --> 02:26:08,509
and that line brought the house down.

2001
02:26:08,676 --> 02:26:10,552
People stood up and cheered.

2002
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:14,431
Probably the most gratifying moment
of my producing career

2003
02:26:14,599 --> 02:26:17,351
was their reaction to that shot.

2004
02:26:17,519 --> 02:26:19,839
(Cameron) When we screened this film,
we knew we had a hit.

2005
02:26:19,938 --> 02:26:21,772
The audience went crazy.

2006
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:24,858
And it was an industry audience,
so they can go either way.

2007
02:26:25,026 --> 02:26:31,865
They'll either be very negative or they'll be
celebratory of a film they think is working.

2008
02:26:32,033 --> 02:26:36,787
Once again, you have a mixture of full-size
power loader and queen and miniature.

2009
02:26:36,955 --> 02:26:39,289
This is all pretty much full-size here,

2010
02:26:39,457 --> 02:26:44,169
which shows you how well-articulated
what Stan Winston's guys did.

2011
02:26:44,337 --> 02:26:50,634
(Robert) These shots of the power loader
taking big swings were quarter-scale shots.

2012
02:26:50,802 --> 02:26:55,180
That's the kind of action that would
have been very hard to stage successfully

2013
02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:58,434
with any kind of dynamics in full scale.

2014
02:26:58,601 --> 02:27:02,187
Thinking about it,
this looks like a heavyweight machine,

2015
02:27:02,355 --> 02:27:06,066
and it was actually just flimsy plastic.

2016
02:27:06,234 --> 02:27:10,446
(Dennis) You'd probably lift a lot of that
if it were in pieces.

2017
02:27:10,613 --> 02:27:15,742
(Robert) That whole arm, that claw
mechanism, only weighed a pound or so.

2018
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:18,412
(McClung) It had some sort
of a counterweight,

2019
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:21,582
cos so much weight
is pushed out forward.

2020
02:27:21,749 --> 02:27:27,379
You forget again that there was a bodybuilder
inside of there helping to manipulate it.

2021
02:27:27,547 --> 02:27:33,093
(Dennis) Basically, Sigourney was standing
on the fronts of his feet, as I recall.

2022
02:27:34,596 --> 02:27:40,100
And a quarter-scale version of the airlock
was also made, as well as the full-size,

2023
02:27:40,268 --> 02:27:43,353
so, depending on the shots,
the requirements,

2024
02:27:43,521 --> 02:27:45,481
you'd use one or the other.

2025
02:27:50,778 --> 02:27:53,822
(Cameron) Interesting that
we chose not to score this.

2026
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:57,701
I just felt it had a
greater sense of reality

2027
02:27:57,869 --> 02:28:01,705
and it might seem a little over the top
if it was being driven by music,

2028
02:28:01,873 --> 02:28:07,836
whereas it plays very real,
somehow, without music.

2029
02:28:10,965 --> 02:28:15,552
I think the score cuts in
when the queen grabs her.

2030
02:28:16,971 --> 02:28:22,476
That lever's always right there that allows
you to depressure your entire spacecraft.

2031
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:26,522
It's a bit like the button in the Krell lab
that blows up the planet

2032
02:28:26,689 --> 02:28:29,358
that you put in the children's
learning room.

2033
02:28:31,152 --> 02:28:33,278
(Hurd) And this is so terrific.

2034
02:28:33,446 --> 02:28:38,659
(Winston) We had a little trolley
underneath the set that he would ride on.

2035
02:28:38,826 --> 02:28:43,038
(Robert) The shot as the queen falls away
was done in miniature.

2036
02:28:43,206 --> 02:28:48,001
We had taken pieces of the set up to the
top of the stage and dropped them away.

2037
02:28:48,169 --> 02:28:53,882
We had people physically holding a large
sheet of black cloth, sort of fireman-style,

2038
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:59,012
standing on the stage floor, and we dropped
these pieces from the top of the stage.

2039
02:28:59,722 --> 02:29:02,474
(Cameron) There's an
interesting thing here.

2040
02:29:02,642 --> 02:29:08,730
When Newt slides, Bishop, you see
his body, you see how the gag is done.

2041
02:29:08,898 --> 02:29:12,734
Lance is down through the set.
It shows you how people watch a movie.

2042
02:29:12,902 --> 02:29:15,821
They watch the hands,
whether he's gonna miss her,

2043
02:29:15,989 --> 02:29:21,868
and they don't see a bad visual effect that's
happening on the other side of the screen.

2044
02:29:22,579 --> 02:29:27,541
But I was watching it with an audience for
about the fifth time before I saw that myself,

2045
02:29:27,709 --> 02:29:31,044
cos I always looked
where I was supposed to look.

2046
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:36,800
(McClung) The queen was stop-motion,
right, coming out of the Sulaco?

2047
02:29:36,968 --> 02:29:42,431
(Robert) The exterior shot of the queen
was, I think, puppeted bluescreen.

2048
02:29:42,599 --> 02:29:46,143
It's got a bit of a stop-motion quality,
but it's just...

2049
02:29:46,311 --> 02:29:49,605
(Dennis) The original thought
was to use stop motion in this film,

2050
02:29:49,772 --> 02:29:54,401
but the problems of time as well as
the kind of action that stop motion creates

2051
02:29:54,569 --> 02:29:56,361
is different than puppeted.

2052
02:29:56,529 --> 02:29:59,948
(Robert) There was also questions
about these slime elements.

2053
02:30:00,116 --> 02:30:06,371
The thing was always dripping and there was a
lot of real-time elements that were mixed in

2054
02:30:06,539 --> 02:30:08,957
that would have made it hard
to do a stop motion.

2055
02:30:09,125 --> 02:30:15,881
But, again, time was a factor and we had
to do a shot a day or every couple of days

2056
02:30:16,174 --> 02:30:18,258
and cover things with multiple cameras.

2057
02:30:18,426 --> 02:30:21,887
It would have been very impractical
to do it that way.

2058
02:30:22,055 --> 02:30:25,974
(Cameron) She recovers
from her traumatic event pretty quickly.

2059
02:30:26,142 --> 02:30:31,146
But she's been through a lot so she's
got used to this stuff by now, l guess.

2060
02:30:31,314 --> 02:30:34,024
I didn't think
it was appropriate to show Sigourney

2061
02:30:34,192 --> 02:30:37,277
in quite the same sexy underwear
she was in at the end of Alien,

2062
02:30:37,445 --> 02:30:41,156
I'm sure much to the fans'
disappointment.

2063
02:30:41,658 --> 02:30:46,328
(Paxton) It's a movie I'll always be proud
to have been a part of.

2064
02:30:46,496 --> 02:30:51,792
It's great to get together and revisit it
after so many years. It holds up.

2065
02:30:51,959 --> 02:30:55,796
- It was a great experience.
- (Goldstein) This was my first film.

2066
02:30:55,963 --> 02:30:59,966
- (Henriksen) Was that your first film too?
- Yeah. He gave me my first job.

2067
02:31:00,134 --> 02:31:02,594
It was amazing to step into that.

2068
02:31:02,762 --> 02:31:07,974
(Biehn) You do movies
and always have high hopes,

2069
02:31:08,643 --> 02:31:11,478
and it's only a few that turn out

2070
02:31:11,646 --> 02:31:16,483
as great as this one.
That's why it's so special.

2071
02:31:16,651 --> 02:31:22,656
(Paxton) I think at the time we knew
we had a great script, a great director,

2072
02:31:22,824 --> 02:31:26,451
who really knew how
to put this thing on film,

2073
02:31:26,619 --> 02:31:29,996
and there was a great camaraderie
amongst all of us.

2074
02:31:30,164 --> 02:31:32,207
It was great to have
this common purpose

2075
02:31:32,375 --> 02:31:36,294
and know we were making
a great science fiction classic.

2076
02:31:36,462 --> 02:31:42,175
There was no question in any of our minds
that we were involved with a great film.

2077
02:31:42,343 --> 02:31:48,223
We showed up on the set in London and to
see the stagecraft that they had done.

2078
02:31:48,391 --> 02:31:53,186
(Biehn) That's why when people talk to me
about working for Jim Cameron,

2079
02:31:53,354 --> 02:31:59,067
that's why it's so great to work with him,
cos you know you're in great hands.

2080
02:31:59,235 --> 02:32:05,449
There's a possibility that it's gonna be a
great, great movie, a really good possibility.

2081
02:32:05,616 --> 02:32:12,497
(Paxton) We've all had hits and misses
since, but it is a filmmaker's medium.

2082
02:32:12,665 --> 02:32:18,253
(Biehn) When you go into a movie like this, you
just give that extra, added whatever it is,

2083
02:32:18,421 --> 02:32:20,630
cos you know that there's a shot.

2084
02:32:20,798 --> 02:32:23,008
(Goldstein) It surprised me how it went

2085
02:32:23,176 --> 02:32:25,385
across lines of people
who love science fiction

2086
02:32:25,553 --> 02:32:30,515
but beyond that - you don't have to be a
science fiction genre buff to enjoy it at all,

2087
02:32:30,683 --> 02:32:34,102
or it wouldn't have
lasted as long as it has.

2088
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:39,149
(Paxton) And what a challenge,
to be the director of the sequel to Alien,

2089
02:32:39,317 --> 02:32:44,529
which, like you were saying earlier, really
revolutionized science fiction films.

2090
02:32:44,697 --> 02:32:52,078
This was the first monster to come down the
pike that was so intricate and interesting

2091
02:32:52,246 --> 02:32:58,293
in the whole way it evolved, and the
Giger design of the original monster.

2092
02:32:58,461 --> 02:33:04,132
To be bold enough to go
"Yeah, I'll write and direct the sequel."

2093
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:05,509
(Henriksen) Tough duty.

2094
02:33:05,676 --> 02:33:10,055
(Paxton) I don't think anybody else
could've pulled it off.

2095
02:33:11,307 --> 02:33:14,643
(Carrie) I had so much fun
on the Aliens experience.

2096
02:33:14,810 --> 02:33:18,146
- (Chris) A once-in-a-lifetime experience.
- (Carrie) Definitely.

2097
02:33:18,314 --> 02:33:22,359
Who can say that their name comes up
second in the credits?

2098
02:33:22,527 --> 02:33:25,153
Not very many people.

2099
02:33:25,321 --> 02:33:26,363
(Winston) Wow.

2100
02:33:26,531 --> 02:33:28,532
Did we actually make that movie?

2101
02:33:28,699 --> 02:33:30,951
(laughter)

2102
02:33:31,118 --> 02:33:34,871
- (Hurd) For 1 8 million dollars.
- (Winston) It wore me out watching it.

2103
02:33:35,039 --> 02:33:40,877
(Hurd) It was what? A 60-odd day shoot?
It was like a 65-day shoot.

2104
02:33:41,045 --> 02:33:43,964
(Winston) Very proud. We did good.

2105
02:33:44,131 --> 02:33:47,092
- (Hurd) Let's do it again.
- (Winston) Hats off to you, Jim.

2106
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:49,469
The man kicks butt, doesn't he?

2107
02:33:49,637 --> 02:33:51,721
(Hurd) He's the maestro.

2108
02:33:52,807 --> 02:33:55,559
(Cameron) I think in terms
of actual technique,

2109
02:33:55,726 --> 02:33:59,479
it's crude compared to films made now.

2110
02:33:59,647 --> 02:34:05,485
But I think in terms of storytelling,
it's as good as I'll probably ever be,

2111
02:34:05,653 --> 02:34:08,196
which is really what
filmmaking is all about.

2112
02:34:08,364 --> 02:34:12,325
It's about the people,
it's about the relationships.

2113
02:34:12,493 --> 02:34:16,830
Of course, then they made the third film
and killed everybody.

2114
02:34:23,838 --> 02:34:25,158
